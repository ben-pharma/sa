"Allergic diseases are often triggered by environmental allergens that induce dominant type 2 immune responses, characterized by the infiltrated T-helper type 2 (TH2) lymphocytes, eosinophils, and elevated TH2 cytokines. In addition to TH2 type immune responses, epithelial stress and injury linked to tissue remodelling are often observed, suggesting that epithelial cells may play important role in regulating allergic responses. Dendritic cells (DCs), the professional antigen-presenting cells with the capabilities of sampling allergens, are considered as the key player on instructing TH2 immune responses. Whether inflamed epithelium can regulate innate immunity, such as macrophages and DCs, which in turn instructs adaptive immunity has long been hypothesized. Studies of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cells-derived cytokine, that can strongly activate DCs, provide important evidences that the epithelial barrier can trigger allergic diseases by regulating immune responses. The finding that OX40/OX40Ligand (OX40L) interactions are the molecular trigger responsible for the induction and maintenance of TH2 responses by TSLP-activated DCs provides a plausible molecular explanation for TSLP-mediated allergy. Recent progresses in characterizing the pro-inflammatory IL-17 cytokine family have added an additional layer of complexity on the regulation of allergic inflammation. TSLP-DCs can induce a robust expansion of TH2 memory cells and strengthen functional attributes by up-regulating their surface expression of IL-17RB (IL-25R), the receptor for cytokine IL-17E (IL-25), a distinct member of IL-17 cytokine family. IL-17E (also known as IL-25) produced by epithelial cells, and other innate cells, such as eosinphils, basophils, and mast cells, are shown to regulate adaptive immunity by enhancing TH2 cytokine productions. These exciting findings expand our knowledge of the complex immunological cascades that result in allergic inflammation and may provide novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of allergic diseases.;Intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) have been shown to display specialized functions, including the ability to promote gut tropism to lymphocytes, to polarize noninflammatory responses, and to drive the differentiation of adaptive Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. However, very little is known about what drives the mucosal phenotype of DCs. Here, we present evidence that the local microenvironment, and in particular intestinal epithelial cells (ECs), drive the differentiation of T(reg)-cell-promoting DCs, which counteracts Th1 and Th17 development. EC-derived transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and retinoic acid (RA), but not thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), were found to be required for DC conversion. After EC contact, DCs upregulated CD103 and acquired a tolerogenic phenotype. EC-conditioned DCs were capable of inducing de novo T(reg) cells with gut-homing properties that when adoptively transferred, protected mice from experimental colitis. Thus, we have uncovered an essential mechanism in which EC control of DC function is required for tolerance induction.;Sinonasal epithelial cells participate in host defense by initiating innate immune mechanisms against potential pathogens. Antimicrobial innate mechanisms have been shown to involve Th1-like inflammatory responses. Although epithelial cells can also be induced by Th2 cytokines to express proeosinophilic mediators, no environmental agents have been identified that promote this effect.\nHuman sinonasal epithelial cells from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) and controls were harvested and grown in primary culture. Cell cultures were exposed to a range of concentrations of chitin for 24 hours, and mRNA for acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), eotaxin-3, and thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP) were assessed. Other cultures were exposed to interleukin 4 (IL- 4) alone and in combination with dust-mite antigen (DMA) for 36 hours. Extracted mRNA and cell culture supernatant were analyzed for expression of AMCase and eotaxin-3.\nChitin induced a dose-dependent expression of AMCase and eotaxin-3 mRNA but not TSLP. Patients with recalcitrant CRSwNPs showed lower baseline expression of AMCase when compared with treatment-responsive CRSwNP and less induction of AMCase expression by chitin. DMA did not directly induce expression of AMCase or eotaxin-3. Expression of eotaxin-3 was stimulated by IL-4 and further enhanced with the addition of DMA. Levels of AMCase were not significantly affected by either IL-4 or DMA exposure. In some cases, the combination of IL-4 and DMA was able to induce AMCase expression in cell cultures not producing AMCase at baseline.\nThe abundant biopolymer chitin appears to be recognized by a yet uncharacterized receptor on sinonasal epithelial cells. Chitin stimulates production of AMCase and eotaxin-3, two pro-Th2 effector proteins. This finding suggests the existence of a novel innate immune pathway for local defense against chitin-containing organisms in the sinonasal tract. Dysregulation of this function could precipitate or exacerbate Th2 inflammation, potentially acting as an underlying factor in recalcitrant CRSwNP.;IL-7 is critical for B cell production in adult mice; however, its role in human B lymphopoiesis is controversial. One challenge was the inability to differentiate human cord blood (CB) or adult bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without murine stroma. Here, we examine the role of IL-7 in human B cell development using a novel, human-only model based on coculturing human HSCs on primary human BM stroma. In this model, IL-7 increases human B cell production by >60-fold from both CB and adult BM HSCs. IL-7-induced increases are dose-dependent and specific to CD19(+) cells. STAT5 phosphorylation and expression of the Ki-67 proliferation Ag indicate that IL-7 acts directly on CD19(+) cells to increase proliferation at the CD34(+) and CD34(-) pro-B cell stages. Without IL-7, HSCs in CB, but not BM, give rise to a small but consistent population of CD19(lo) B lineage cells that express EBF (early B cell factor) and PAX-5 and respond to subsequent IL-7 stimulation. Flt3 ligand, but not thymic stromal-derived lymhopoietin (TSLP), was required for the IL-7-independent production of human B lineage cells. As compared with CB, adult BM shows a reduction of in vitro generative capacity that is progressively more profound in developmentally sequential populations, resulting in an approximately 50-fold reduction in IL-7-dependent B lineage generative capacity. These data provide evidence that IL-7 is essential for human B cell production from adult BM and that IL-7-induced expansion of the pro-B compartment is increasingly critical for human B cell production during the progression of ontogeny.;Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) produce thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP); however, the in vivo influence of TSLP-TSLP receptor (TSLPR) interactions on immunity and inflammation in the intestine remains unclear. We show that TSLP-TSLPR interactions are critical for immunity to the intestinal pathogen Trichuris. Monoclonal antibody-mediated neutralization of TSLP or deletion of the TSLPR in normally resistant mice resulted in defective expression of Th2 cytokines and persistent infection. Susceptibility was accompanied by elevated expression of interleukin (IL) 12/23p40, interferon (IFN) gamma, and IL-17A, and development of severe intestinal inflammation. Critically, neutralization of IFN-gamma in Trichuris-infected TSLPR(-/-) mice restored Th2 cytokine responses and resulted in worm expulsion, providing the first demonstration of TSLPR-independent pathways for Th2 cytokine production. Additionally, TSLPR(-/-) mice displayed elevated production of IL-12/23p40 and IFN-gamma, and developed heightened intestinal inflammation upon exposure to dextran sodium sulfate, demonstrating a previously unrecognized immunoregulatory role for TSLP in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease.;Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that have the ability to sense infection and tissue stress, sample and present antigen to T lymphocytes, and instruct the initiation of different forms of immunity and tolerance. The functional versatility of DCs depends on their remarkable ability to translate collectively the information from the invading microbes, as well as their resident tissue microenvironments. Recent progress in understanding Toll-like receptor (TLR) biology has illuminated the mechanisms by which DCs link innate and adaptive antimicrobial immune responses. However, how tissue microenvironments shape the function of DCs has remained elusive. Recent studies of TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that strongly activates DCs, provide strong evidence at a molecular level that epithelial cells/tissue microenvironments directly communicate with DCs, the professional antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. We review recent progress on how TSLP expressed within thymus and peripheral lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues regulates DC-mediated central tolerance, peripheral T cell homeostasis, and inflammatory Th2 responses.;Atopic dermatitis (AD) is often the initial step in the ""atopic march,"" given that more than half of AD patients with moderate to severe AD develop asthma later in life. Both AD and asthma share a similar ""atopy"" phenotype that includes T helper type 2 inflammation with eosinophilia and hyper-IgE immunoglobulinemia, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the ""atopic march"" remain elusive. In the present study, we show that induced expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in mouse epidermal keratinocytes upon topical application of MC903 (a low calcemic analogue of vitamin D3) not only triggers AD as we previously reported but also aggravates experimental allergic asthma induced by ovalbumin sensitization and challenge. Our study, which provides a mouse model to study human ""atopic march,"" indicates that keratinocyte-produced TSLP may represent an important factor in the link of atopic dermatitis to asthma.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin (IL)-7-like cytokine that triggers dendritic cell-mediated T helper (Th)2 inflammatory responses through a receptor consisting of a heterodimer of the IL-7 receptor alpha (IL-7Ralpha) chain and the TSLP receptor (TSLPR), which resembles the cytokine receptor common gamma chain. Dendritic cells activated by TSLP prime development of CD4(+) T cells into Th2 cells contributing to the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. We hypothesized that allergen exposure induces expression of TSLP and results in recruitment of TSLPR bearing cells in the cutaneous allergen-induced late-phase reaction (LPR) in atopic subjects.\nSkin biopsies were obtained from atopic subjects (n = 9) at various times after cutaneous allergen challenge. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to determine TSLP mRNA expression and to measure infiltration of TSLPR(+) DC in skin LPR. RT-PCR and flow cytometry were employed to analyse TSLPR expression on isolated blood DC.\nAllergen-induced skin TSLP expression occurred as early as 1 h after allergen challenge, whereas TSLPR(+) and CD11c(+) cells infiltrated relatively late (24-48 h). The majority of TSLPR(+) cells were DC co-expressing blood DC antigen-1 (BDCA-1) or BDCA-2. Freshly isolated blood DC expressed both TSLPR and IL-7Ralpha chains. Maturation and stimulation with TSLP or polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid in vitro upregulated the expression of both TSLPR and IL-7Ralpha chains in DC but not in chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells(+) CD4(+) T cells.\nThe data suggest that TSLP plays a role in augmenting, through DC recruitment and activation, the development of Th2-type T cells in allergic inflammation.;A significant increase of mRNA expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been reported in the bronchial mast cells (MCs) of asthmatic subjects; however, the mechanism underlying the upregulation of TSLP mRNA and protein remains unknown. FcepsilonRI-mediated activation of human MCs upregulated TSLP mRNA expression by 5.2+/-2.9-fold, while activation of the MCs using lipopolysaccharide and polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid failed to upregulate TSLP. Stimulation of MCs with interleukin (IL)-4 alone did not affect the TSLP mRNA expression, while pre-incubation of MCs with IL-4 for 48 h significantly enhanced the FcepsilonRI-mediated TSLP mRNA expression (by 53.7+/-15.9-fold; p<0.05) and the amount of TSLP in the cell pellets increased significantly from 23.4+/-4.3 pg mL(-1) to 121.5+/-3.7 pg mL(-1) (p<0.0001). However, the released TSLP was rapidly degraded by proteases that were released by MCs. We identified the population of cells expressing TSLP in the lungs of 16 asthmatic and 11 control subjects by immunohistochemistry. The percentage of TSLP-positive MCs in the total population of MCs was significantly increased in asthmatic airways (p<0.0001). Thus, MCs are able to store TSLP intracellularly and to produce TSLP following aggregation of FcepsilonRI in the presence of IL-4.;There is compelling evidence that epithelial cells (ECs) at mucosal surfaces, beyond their role in creating a physical barrier, are integral components of innate and adaptive immunity. The capacity of these cells to license the functions of specific immune cell populations in the airway and gastrointestinal tract offers the prospect of novel therapeutic strategies to target multiple inflammatory diseases in which barrier immunity is dysregulated. In this review, we discuss the critical functions of EC-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 in the development and regulation of T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine-dependent immune responses. We first highlight recent data that have provided new insights into the factors that control expression of this triad of cytokines and their receptors. In addition, we review their proinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions in models of mucosal infection and inflammation. Lastly, we discuss new findings indicating that despite their diverse structural features and differential expression of their receptors, TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 cross-regulate one another and share overlapping properties that influence Th2 cytokine-dependent responses at mucosal sites.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is crucial for the development of atopic diseases in humans and mice. Mice that express a lung-specific TSLP transgene (surfactant protein C promoter (SPC)-TSLP) develop a spontaneous and progressive asthma-like disease, suggesting that TSLP expression alone was sufficient for disease development. In this study, we show that, in fact, TSLP alone only causes a weak innate response that is insufficient for development of full airway inflammatory disease. Complete disease development requires both TSLP and antigenic stimulation. These data suggest that the spontaneous lung inflammation observed in SPC-TSLP mice reflects a TSLP-driven predisposition toward the development of aberrant responses against innocuous environmental Ags. This provides evidence that TSLP may act directly to induce susceptibility to the inappropriate allergic responses that characterize atopy and asthma. We additionally show that disease development requires CD4 T cells but not B cells. Further, we reveal a TSLP-driven innate response involving mucus overproduction and goblet cell metaplasia. Taken together, these data suggest a multifaceted model of TSLP-mediated airway inflammation, with an initial activation of resident innate immune cells, followed by activation of the adaptive immune system and full disease development. This study provides new insight into the unique features of the asthma pathology contributed by the innate and adaptive immune responses in response to TSLP stimulation.;To explore the crucial role of the human corneal epithelium-derived proallergic cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in initiation and regulation of immune responses.\nPrimary corneal epithelial cells, established from donor limbal explants, were treated with 11 microbial ligands and proinflammatory and Th2 cytokines, alone or in combination. TSLP mRNA and protein were determined by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. NF-kappaB activation was detected by immunostaining and Western blot.\nTSLP was found to be expressed by human corneal epithelium and its cultures. TSLP in corneal epithelial cells were largely induced in a concentration-dependent fashion by polyI:C, flagellin, and FSL-1, the ligands for toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, -5, and -6, respectively. Compared with the control, TSLP mRNA was increased by 60-, 12- and 8-fold and TSLP protein increased by 67-, 19- and 7-fold by these three ligands, respectively. The proinflammatory (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) cytokines moderately induced TSLP expression and production. IL-4 and -13 strongly synergized with PolyI:C, flagellin, and TNF-alpha to promote TSLP production in ex vivo tissues and in vitro cultures of corneal epithelium. PolyI:C, flagellin, or TNF-alpha also induced NF-kappaB p65 protein nuclear translocation. The NF-kappaB inhibitor quinazoline blocked p65 nuclear translocation and further suppressed TSLP expression and production induced by these stimuli.\nThese findings provide the first evidence of TSLP induction in the human eye and suggest the novel phenomenon that human corneal epithelium-derived TSLP may serve as a link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. TSLP may become a novel therapeutic target for allergic and inflammatory ocular surface diseases.;19109125'};We confirmed previously the existence of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-positive cells in murine placenta by flow cytometry. To compare the characteristics of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TSLP-mediated placental dendritic cell (DC) activation, pregnant BALB/c mouse mated with C57BL/6 male were used as a model of allogenic gestation. Placental CD11c(+) DCs were potently activated by the TLR3-agonist polyinosinic polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)], subsequently causing increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Accordingly, increased intracellular production of interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma, but not IL-4 or IL-10, were detected after stimulation by poly (I:C). In the case of TSLP-stimulation, although increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules was also detected, there was no substantial increase of intracellular production of IL-12, IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-10. In contrast, the expression of the Th2 cell-attracting chemokine, the thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) or CCL17, was significantly boosted in response to TSLP induction, whereas no significant increase of CCL17 was observed when triggering TLR3 with its specific agonist poly (I:C). The data were further supported by a CD4(+)IL-10(+) cell migratory assay. These results suggest that TSLP-TSLP receptor interaction may result in a Th2-type microenvironment at the feto-maternal interface by inducing the production of Th2 cell-attracting chemokine and modulating the immigration of Th2-type cells.;A FITC-induced allergic contact hypersensitivity model was used to investigate the role that the prostaglandin D(2) receptor-chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T(h)2 cells (CRTH2) plays in modulating cutaneous inflammation. Our results show that inhibition of CRTH2, achieved via administration of a potent, small molecule antagonist, Compound A (Cmpd A), effectively blocked edema formation and greatly reduced the inflammatory infiltrate and skin pathology observed in drug vehicle-treated animals. Gene expression analysis revealed that Cmpd A administration down-regulated the transcription of a wide range of pro-inflammatory mediators. This correlated with decreases in cytokine and chemokine protein levels, notably IL-4, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, GRO-alpha, MIP-2 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in FITC-challenged ears. The administration of an anti-TSLP-neutralizing antibody was only partially effective in lowering the FITC-induced inflammatory infiltrate and cytokine production compared with the CRTH2 antagonist. Taken together, these data suggest that blockade of CRTH2 inhibits multiple pathways leading to cutaneous inflammation in this model. This suggests that CRTH2 antagonism may be a viable route for therapeutic intervention in allergic skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis.;In steady state, hemopoietic progenitors constantly egress from the bone marrow (BM) into the blood and circulate through the peripheral tissues. In allergic diseases, the BM releases increased numbers of CD34(+) progenitor cells that migrate to the site of allergic inflammation, where they differentiate into tissue-dwelling and classic effector cells of allergy, such as mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils.\nTo examine whether peripheral blood CD34(+) cells in addition to being progenitors may also directly function as inflammatory effector cells.\nHighly purified neonatal or adult blood CD34(+) cells were examined for the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IL-33 receptors and for their response to these cytokines as well as to supernatants of primary small airway epithelial cells and nasal explants from rhinosinusitis and control subjects. Sputum of patients with asthma was examined before and after allergen inhalation for the presence of IL-5 and IL-13-containing CD34(+) cells.\nCirculating CD34(+) cells expressed receptors for TSLP and IL-33 and responded to these cytokines by rapidly releasing high levels of proinflammatory T(H)2-like cytokines and chemokines. These cells were activated in a TSLP-dependent manner by the supernatant fluids from activated primary human small airway epithelial cells and from nasal explants of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Moreover, activated CD34(+) cells containing IL-5 and IL-13 could be detected in the sputum of individuals with allergic asthma, with numbers increasing in response to specific allergen inhalation challenge.\nBlood CD34(+) cells, in addition to being progenitors, may act as proinflammatory effector cells by themselves and directly contribute to the allergic inflammation.;19056108'};BACKGROUND"" Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is expressed in the human asthmatic lung and activates dendritic cells (DCs) to strongly induce proallergic T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell responses, suggesting that TSLP plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of human asthma. Th2 cells are predominantly involved in mild asthma, whereas a mixture of Th1 and Th2 cells with neutrophilic inflammation, probably induced by Th17, affects more severe asthmatic disease. Exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation is often triggered by airway-targeting RNA viral infection; virus-derived double-stranded RNA, Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 ligand, activates bronchial epithelial cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, including TSLP.\nBecause TSLPR-expressing DCs express TLR3, we examined how the relationship between TSLP and TLR3 ligand stimulation influences DC activation.\nCD11c(+)DCs purified from adult peripheral blood were cultured in TLR ligands containing media with or without TSLP and then co-cultured with allogeneic naïve CD4(+)T cells.\nCD11c(+) DCs responded to a combination of TSLP and TLR3 ligand, poly(I : C), to up-regulate expression of the functional TSLP receptor and TLR3. Although TSLP alone did not induce IL-23 production by DCs, poly(I : C) alone primed DCs for the production of IL-23, and a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed DCs for further production of IL-23. The addition of poly(I : C) did not inhibit TSLP-activated DCs to prime naïve CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells. Furthermore, DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed more naïve CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into Th17-cytokine-producing cells with a central memory T cell phenotype compared with DCs activated by poly(I : C) alone.\nThese results suggest that through DC activation, human TSLP and TLR3 ligands promote differentiation of Th17 cells with the central memory T cell phenotype under Th2-polarizing conditions.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine produced by stromal cells, epithelial cells, and basophils that acts on dendritic cells, mast cells, and CD4(+) T cells. The receptor for TSLP contains a TSLP-specific receptor chain (TSLPR) and the IL-7R alpha-chain. Although IL-7 critically controls the expansion and survival of naive and memory CD8(+) T cells, an action for TSLP on CD8(+) T cells has not been reported. We now demonstrate that CD8(+) T cells express TSLPR and that TSLP activates both STAT5 and Akt and induces Bcl-2 in these cells. Correspondingly, TSLP increases CD8(+) T cell survival in vitro as well as in wild-type and T-depleted mice in vivo, without altering the homeostatic proliferation of these cells. Moreover, TSLP can maintain CD8(+) T cells even in the absence of IL-7. Thus, our data reveal that TSLP contributes to CD8(+) T cell homeostasis in both normal and lymphopenic conditions.;To determine whether thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays a role in the resorption of herniated disc tissue.\nThe expression of TSLP messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein in mouse intervertebral disc cells was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemical analysis. The ability of mouse intervertebral disc cells to respond to TSLP stimulation was examined by Western blot analysis, ELISA, and protein array analysis. Intracellular signaling pathways involved in TSLP signaling in mouse intervertebral disc cells were investigated using several chemical inhibitors. The role of TSLP in macrophage migration into the intervertebral disc was assessed by in vitro migration assay. Finally, TSLP expression in clinical specimens derived from patients with a herniated disc was examined by immunohistochemistry.\nMouse intervertebral disc cells expressed TSLP mRNA and protein upon stimulation with NF-kappaB-activating ligands such as tumor necrosis factor alpha. In addition, the mouse intervertebral disc cells expressed the TSLP receptor and produced monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1; CCL2) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to TSLP stimulation. Both anulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus intervertebral disc cells expressed MCP-1 upon TSLP stimulation, which was mediated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Consistently, the supernatants of TSLP-activated intervertebral disc cultures had the capacity to induce macrophage migration in an MCP-1-dependent manner. Finally, TSLP and MCP-1 were coexpressed in human herniated disc specimens in which macrophage infiltration into the tissue was observed.\nTSLP induced by NF-kappaB-activating ligands in intervertebral discs may contribute to the recruitment of macrophages to the intervertebral disc by stimulating MCP-1 production and may be involved in the resorption of herniated disc tissue.;Lung-specific thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) expression is sufficient for the development of an asthma-like chronic airway inflammatory disease. However, the nature of the downstream pathways that regulate disease development are not known. In this study, we used IL-4- and Stat6-deficient mice to establish the role of Th2-type responses downstream of TSLP. IL-4 deficiency greatly reduced, but did not eliminate, TSLP-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and goblet cell metaplasia, while Stat6 deficiency eliminated these asthma-like symptoms. We further demonstrate, using the chronic model of TSLP-mediated airway inflammation, that blockade of both IL-4 and IL-13 responses, through administration of an anti-IL-4R alpha mAb, reversed asthma-like symptoms, when given to mice with established disease. Collectively these data provide insight into the pathways engaged in TSLP-driven airway inflammation and demonstrate that simultaneous blockade of IL-4 and IL-13 can reverse established airway disease, suggesting that this may be an effective approach for the therapy of Th2-mediated inflammatory respiratory disease.;Both active and passive smoking are considered to be risk factors for asthma development. However, the precise mechanisms involved remain elusive. Recently, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been shown to play a key role in the development of T(H)2-type allergic inflammation in patients with asthma.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a causal relationship between cigarette smoke exposure and TSLP expression in the lung.\nWe examined the effects of repeated intranasal exposure of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on TSLP mRNA and protein expression in the mouse lung by means of real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We also examined the effects of intranasal exposure of CSE plus ovalbumin (OVA) on T(H)2-type immune responses and lung pathology.\nRepeated exposure of CSE induced TSLP mRNA and protein expression, which was inhibited by treatment with antioxidative N-acetylcysteine and by TNF-alpha receptor I deficiency. In addition, the intranasal exposure of CSE simultaneously with OVA induced OVA-specific T(H)2-type immune responses and airway inflammation, which were inhibited by the blockade of the TSLP activity.\nCSE induced TSLP expression in the mouse lung in an oxidative stress-dependent and TNF-alpha receptor I-dependent manner, and when challenged simultaneously with an antigen, CSE promoted the development of airway inflammation in association with T(H)2-type immune responses.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin (IL)-7-like cytokine and has been shown to be one of the factors released by epithelial cells following allergen contact with an important role instructing dendritic cells (DCs) to induce a T-helper type 2 (Th2) response. These TSLP-DC stimulate CD4(+) T cells to induce a proallergic cytokine profile, suggesting TSLP plays a crucial role in the initiation of the allergic cascade. Recently, evidence has also accumulated that TSLP could play a role in enhancement of the effector stages of the allergic response, with TSLP in synergy with IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha shown to amplify cytokine secretion from mast cells. Also, the clinical relevance of TSLP has been demonstrated by both high levels of TSLP in skin biopsies from lesional atopic dermatitis patients and also increased expression of TSLP in asthmatic airway epithelial cells which correlated with reduced lung function. These studies suggest a critical role for TSLP as a driving factor in the emerging concept of tissue-specific control of immunity with TSLP secretion at the epithelial-DC interface acting as an initial factor in the proallergic cascade.;Atopic dermatitis is a major allergic disease that develops through dysregulation of Th2-mediated inflammation. Although dendritic cells (DCs) have been thought to play a critical role in the upstream phase of the allergic cascade, conventional drugs such as steroids and chemical mediator antagonists target the effector cells or factors in allergic inflammation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that interaction between thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and human DCs plays an essential role in evoking inflammatory Th2 responses in allergy through OX40 ligand expression on DCs. In this study, we provide evidence that R848, an imidazoquinoline compound, which is a TLR ligand and a strong Th1 response-inducing reagent, is a potent adjuvant for the alteration of the Th2-inducing potency of human DCs activated by TSLP (TSLP-DCs). R848 inhibited the inflammatory Th2-inducing capacity of TSLP-DCs and redirected them to possessing an IL-10 and IFN-gamma-producing regulatory Th1-inducing capacity. This functional alteration depended on both repression of OX40 ligand expression and induction of IL-12 production from DCs by the addition of R848. Additionally, R848 had the ability to inhibit the TSLP-mediated expansion and maintenance of the Th2 memory response. These findings suggest that imidazoquinoline may be a useful in the treatment of allergic diseases that are triggered by TSLP.;The epithelial-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has important roles in the initiation of allergic airway c airway inflammation and the activation of dendritic cells. We have shown that the human TSLP gene is regulated in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner; however the factors that negatively regulate TSLP expression are not known. In this study we demonstrate that 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) is a negative regulator of TSLP expression in airway epithelial cells. This inhibition is manifested as a block in the IL-1beta-mediated recruitment of NF-kappaB to the human TSLP promoter. 9-cis-RA-mediated inhibition is not restricted to TSLP gene expression but rather reflects a general inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, as other NF-kappaB-regulated-genes were also inhibited in a similar manner by 9-cis-RA treatment. Taken as a whole, these data demonstrate that inhibition of IL-1beta-dependent genes by active retinoid X receptors involves antagonism of NF-kappaB signaling.;The rising worldwide prevalence of asthma has intensified interest in the natural history of asthma. An improved understanding of the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors contributing to the inception and exacerbation of asthma will be crucial to efforts to devise effective preventive and therapeutic interventions. There is increasing evidence that the complex interplay of early life respiratory viral infections and allergic sensitization is important in the development of asthma. Major causes of asthma exacerbations are respiratory viral infections and aeroallergen exposure, which may have interactive co-morbid effects. This review describes the potential role of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) as a connection between the innate immune response to respiratory viral infections and the type-2 adaptive immune response in the development and exacerbation of asthma.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an IL-7-like cytokine that triggers dendritic cell-mediated T helper (Th)2 inflammatory responses, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases in humans. Two TSLP splice variants have been reported. To find functional genetic variants that might contribute to disease, we conducted analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TSLP gene in human bronchial epithelial cells. We surveyed SNPs on the TSLP gene by sequencing genomic DNA from 36 subjects, and characterized the linkage disequilibrium of the gene. We examined whether the SNPs have functional effects on mRNA expression or protein production using real-time PCR, reporter gene analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We identified a total of 23 polymorphisms in the TSLP gene. The long form of TSLP, which is associated with allergic inflammation, was highly induced by poly(I:C) (double-stranded RNA) stimulation in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) (P = 0.0060). The SNP rs3806933 (-847C > T) in the promoter region of long-form TSLP was found to create a binding site for the transcription factor activating protein (AP)-1, and in vitro functional analyses demonstrated that the SNP enhanced AP-1 binding to the regulatory element. The functional variant increased promoter-reporter activity of long-form TSLP in response to poly(I:C) stimulation in NHBE. Functional genetic polymorphism of the TSLP gene appears to contribute to Th2-polarized immunity through higher TSLP production by bronchial epithelial cells in response to viral respiratory infections.;The epithelial-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is sufficient to induce asthma or atopic dermatitis-like phenotypes when selectively overexpressed in transgenic mice, or when driven by topical application of vitamin D3 or low-calcemic analogues. Although T and B cells have been reported to be dispensable for the TSLP-induced inflammation in these models, little is known about the downstream pathways or additional cell types involved in the inflammatory response driven by TSLP. To characterize the downstream effects of TSLP in vivo, we examined the effects of exogenous administration of TSLP protein to wild-type and genetically deficient mice. TSLP induced a systemic Th2 inflammatory response characterized by increased circulating IgE and IgG1 as well as increased draining lymph node size and cellularity, Th2 cytokine production in draining lymph node cultures, inflammatory cell infiltrates, epithelial hyperplasia, subcuticular fibrosis, and up-regulated Th2 cytokine and chemokine messages in the skin. Responses to TSLP in various genetically deficient mice demonstrated T cells and eosinophils were required, whereas mast cells and TNF-alpha were dispensable. TSLP-induced responses were significantly, but not completely reduced in IL-4- and IL-13-deficient mice. These results shed light on the pathways and cell types involved in TSLP-induced inflammation.;NF-kappaB activation in bronchial epithelial cells is important for the development of allergic airway inflammation, and may control the expression of critical mediators of allergic inflammation such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and the chemokine CCL20. Members of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family of proteins are differentially expressed in tissue and help mediate NF-kappaB activity in response to numerous stimuli. Here we demonstrate that CARMA3 (CARD10) is specifically expressed in human airway epithelial cells, and that expression of CARMA3 in these cells leads to activation of NF-kappaB. CARMA3 has recently been shown to mediate NF-kappaB activation in embryonic fibroblasts after stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid-mediator that is elevated in the lungs of individuals with asthma. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that stimulation of airway epithelial cells with LPA leads to increased expression of TSLP and CCL20. We then show that inhibition of CARMA3 activity in airway epithelial cells reduces LPA-mediated NF-kappaB activity and the production of TSLP and CCL20. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that LPA stimulates TSLP and CCL20 expression in bronchial epithelial cells via CARMA3-mediated NF-kappaB activation.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) emerges as a central mediator of T helper cell (Th)2-dominant allergic diseases. However, the role of TSLP receptor (TSLPR) in allergen-induced Th2 priming, and the effects of TSLP signaling blocking on the development of asthma remain unclear. Here we showed that allergen challenge caused a rapid accumulation of TSLP in the airways of asthmatic mice, correlating well with eosinophils counts and interleukin (IL)-5 productions. When TSLP signaling was blocked by intratracheal administration of anti-TSLPR antibody before sensitization, eosinophilic airway inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia and Th2 cytokines productions were significantly reduced. The alleviating effects of TSLPR blocking were achieved by inhibition of maturation and migration of airway dendritic cells (DCs), as well as their abilities of initiating CD4+T cell responses. Thus, local application of anti-TSLPR prevented Th2-mediated airway inflammation, at least partly, by regulating DCs function, which might be exploited to develop novel treatments for asthma.;Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) promotes CD4(+) T-cell proliferation both directly and indirectly through dendritic cell (DC) activation. Although human TSLP-activated DCs induce CD8(+) T-cell proliferation, it is not clear whether TSLP acts directly on CD8(+) T cells. In this study, we show that human CD8(+) T cells activated by T-cell receptor stimulation expressed TSLP receptor (TSLPR), and that TSLP directly enhanced proliferation of activated CD8(+) T cells. Although non-stimulated human CD8(+) T cells from peripheral blood did not express TSLPR, CD8(+) T cells activated by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 did express TSLPR. After T-cell receptor stimulation, TSLP directly enhanced the expansion of activated CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, using monocyte-derived DCs pulsed with a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific pp65 peptide, we found that although interleukin-2 allowed expansion of both CMV-specific and non-specific CD8(+) T cells, TSLP induced expansion of only CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells. These results suggest that human TSLP directly enhances expansion of CD8(+) T cells and that the direct and indirect action of TSLP on expansion of target antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells may be beneficial to adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy.; Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a novel interleukin-7-like cytokine, triggers dendritic cell-mediated inflammatory responses ultimately executed by T helper cells of the Th2 subtype. TSLP emerged as a central player in the development of allergic symptoms, especially in the airways, and is a prime regulatory cytokine at the interface of virus- or antigen-exposed epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs). DCs activated by epithelium-derived TSLP can promote naïve CD4+ T cells to adopt a Th2 phenotype, which in turn recruite eosinophilic and basophilic granulocytes as well as mast cells into the airway mucosa. These different cells secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines operative in inducing an allergic inflammation and atopic asthma. TSLP is, thus, involved in the control of both an innate and an adaptive immune response. Since TSLP links contact of allergen with the airway epithelium to the onset and maintainance of the asthmatic syndrome, defining the signal transduction underlying TSLP expression and function is of profound interest for a better understandimg of the disease and for the development of new therapeutics.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) played an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis (AR) and can be regarded a potential therapeutic target for the management of AR.\nTo evaluate the possible role of TSLP in the pathogenesis of AR.\nWe enrolled 16 patients of AR to investigate the expression of TSLP in nasal mucosa and evaluate the link of TSLP and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Expression of TSLP was detected by immunohistochemical analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and concentrations of TSLP and IL-4 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nTSLP was detected in all samples and the mRNA and protein expression of TSLP is increased significantly in AR nasal mucosa compared with normal control (P<0.05). TSLP production is tightly correlated with IL-4 and severity of AR (P<0.05).;Common gamma chain (gammac)-receptor dependent cytokines are required for regulatory T cell (Treg) development as gammac(-/-) mice lack Tregs. However, it is unclear which gammac-dependent cytokines are involved in this process. Furthermore, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has also been suggested to play a role in Treg development. In this study, we demonstrate that developing CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the thymus express the IL-2Rbeta, IL-4Ralpha, IL-7Ralpha, IL-15Ralpha, and IL-21Ralpha chains, but not the IL9Ralpha or TSLPRalpha chains. Moreover, only IL-2, and to a much lesser degree IL-7 and IL-15, were capable of transducing signals in CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs as determined by monitoring STAT5 phosphorylation. Likewise, IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, but not TSLP, were capable of inducing the conversion of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(-) thymic Treg progenitors into CD4(+)Foxp3(+) mature Tregs in vitro. To examine this issue in more detail, we generated IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x IL-7Ralpha(-/-) and IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x IL-4Ralpha(-/-) mice. We found that IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x IL-7Ralpha(-/-) mice were devoid of Tregs thereby recapitulating the phenotype observed in gammac(-/-) mice; in contrast, the phenotype observed in IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x IL-4Ralpha(-/-) mice was comparable to that seen in IL-2Rbeta(-/-) mice. Finally, we observed that Tregs from both IL-2(-/-) and IL-2Rbeta(-/-) mice show elevated expression of IL-7Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha chains. Addition of IL-2 to Tregs from IL-2(-/-) mice led to rapid down-regulation of these receptors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IL-2 plays the predominant role in Treg development, but that in its absence the IL-7Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha chains are up-regulated and allow for IL-7 and IL-15 to partially compensate for loss of IL-2.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine expressed by epithelial cells, including keratinocytes, and is important in allergic inflammation. Allergic skin inflammation elicited by epicutaneous immunization of mice with ovalbumin (OVA), a potential model of atopic dermatitis, was severely impaired in TSLPR(-/-) mice, as evidenced by decreased infiltration of eosinophils and decreased local expression of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines. However, secretion of Th2 cytokines by splenocytes from epicutaneous sensitized TSLPR(-/-) mice in response to OVA was normal. Skin dendritic cells from TSLPR(-/-) mice were normal in their ability to migrate to draining lymph nodes, express activation markers, and induce proliferation and Th2 cytokine production by naïve T cells. CD4(+) T cells from TSLPR(-/-) mice expressed the skin homing receptor E-selectin ligand normally, and homed to the skin normally, but failed to transfer allergic skin inflammation to WT recipients. TSLP enhanced Th2 cytokine secretion in vitro by targeting TSLPR on antigen specific T cells. Intradermal injection of anti-TSLP blocked the development of allergic skin inflammation after cutaneous antigen challenge of OVA immunized WT mice. These findings suggest that TSLP is essential for antigen driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin infiltrating effector T cells and could be a therapeutic target in allergic skin inflammation.;Allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma develop as a consequence of dysregulated T(h)2 responses. Recently, it has been demonstrated that interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an IL-7-like cytokine, is essential for evoking T(h)2 responses in allergy. In this study, we investigated whether Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a strong T(h)1 response-inducing adjuvant, can alter the function of DCs activated by TSLP (TSLP-DCs). We demonstrated that BCG redirects TSLP-DCs away from inducing inflammatory T(h)2 cells that produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and toward regulatory T(h)1 cells that produce IFN-gamma and IL-10. We also demonstrated that this functional alteration of TSLP-DCs by BCG depended on both production of IL-12 from DCs and down-regulation of OX40 ligand, a member of the TNF family, on DCs. These findings suggest that BCG might be a useful adjuvant for the treatment of allergic diseases that are triggered by TSLP.;Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with Th2 and Th1 differentiated T cells. The cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) promotes differentiation of Th2 T cells and secretion of chemokines which preferentially attract them. We hypothesized that there is distinct airways expression of TSLP and chemokines which preferentially attract Th1- and Th2-type T cells, and influx of T cells bearing their receptors in asthma and COPD. In situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA were used to examine the expression and cellular provenance of TSLP, Th2-attracting (TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22, I-309/CCL1), and Th1-attracting (IP-10/CXCL10, I-TAC/CXCL11) chemokines in the bronchial mucosa and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of subjects with moderate/severe asthma, COPD, and controls. Cells expressing mRNA encoding TSLP, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22, and IP-10/CXCL10, but not I-TAC/CXCL11 and I-309/CCL1, were significantly increased in severe asthma and COPD as compared with non-smoker controls (p < 0.02). This pattern was reflected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentrations. Expression of the same chemokines was also increased in ex- and current smokers. The cellular sources of TSLP and chemokines were strikingly similar in severe asthma and COPD. The numbers of total bronchial mucosal T cells expressing the chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR8, and CXCR3 did not significantly differ in asthma, COPD, and controls. Both asthma and COPD are associated with elevated bronchial mucosal expression of TSLP and the same Th1- and Th2-attracting chemokines. Increased expression of these chemokines is not, however, associated with selective accumulation of T cells bearing their receptors.;18665959'};Interleukin-7 (IL-7), a cytokine produced by stromal cells, is required for thymic development and peripheral homeostasis of most major subsets of T cells. We examined whether regulatory T (Treg) cells also required the IL-7 pathway by analyzing IL-7Ralpha(-/-) mice. We observed a striking reduction in cells with the Treg surface phenotype (CD4, CD25, GITR (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-like receptor), CD45RB, CD62L, CD103) or intracellular markers (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, CTLA-4, and forkhead box transcription factor 3, Foxp3). Foxp3 transcripts were virtually absent in IL-7Ralpha(-/-) lymphoid tissues, and no Treg cell suppressive activity could be detected. There are 2 known ligands for IL-7Ralpha: IL-7 itself and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Surprisingly, mice deficient in IL-7 or the other chain of the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) developed relatively normal numbers of Treg cells. Combined deletion of IL-7 and TSLP receptor greatly reduced Treg cell development in the thymus but was not required for survival of mature peripheral Treg cells. We conclude that Treg cells, like other T cells, require signals from the IL-7 receptor, but unlike other T cells, do not require IL-7 itself because of at least partially overlapping actions of IL-7 and TSLP for development of Treg cells.;Phenotypically and functionally distinct progenitors and developmental pathways have been proposed to exist for fetally derived B-1 and conventional B-2 cells. Although IL-7 appears to be the primary cytokine regulator of fetal and adult B lymphopoiesis in mice, considerable fetal B lymphopoiesis and postnatal B cells are sustained in the absence of IL-7; in humans, B-cell generation is suggested to be largely IL-7-independent, as severe combined immune-deficient patients with IL-7 deficiency appear to have normal B-cell numbers. However, the role of other cytokines in IL-7-independent B lymphopoiesis remains to be established. Although thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been proposed to be the main factor driving IL-7-independent B lymphopoiesis and to distinguish fetal from adult B-cell progenitor development in mice, recent studies failed to support a primary role of TSLP in IL-7-independent fetal B-cell development. However, the role of TSLP in IL-7-independent adult B lymphopoiesis and in particular in regulation of B-1 cells remains to be established. Here we demonstrate that, rather than TSLP, IL-7 and FLT3 ligand are combined responsible for all B-cell generation in mice, including recently identified B-1-specified cell progenitors. Thus, the same IL-7- and FLT3 ligand-mediated signal-ing regulates alternative pathways of fetal and adult B-1 and B-2 lymphopoiesis.;Epigenetic changes have been implicated in silencing several B-cell genes in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRS) of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and this mechanism has been proposed to promote HRS survival and escape from immunosurveillance. However, the molecular and functional consequences of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition in HL have not been previously described. In this study, we report that the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat induced p21 expression and decreased Bcl-xL levels   causing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, vorinostat inhibited STAT6 phosphorylation and decreased its mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was associated with a decrease in the expression and secretion of Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and interleukin (IL)-5 and an increase in IP-10 levels. Moreover, vorino-stat inhibited TARC secretion by dendritic cells that were activated by the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Collectively, these data suggest that pharmacologic HDAC inhibition in HL may induce favorable antitumor activity by a direct antiproliferative effect on HRS cells, and possibly by an immune mediated effect by altering cytokine and chemokines secretion in the microenvironment.;Epidermal keratinocytes form a highly organized stratified epithelium and sustain a competent barrier function together with dermal and hematopoietic cells. The Notch signaling pathway is a critical regulator of epidermal integrity. Here, we show that keratinocyte-specific deletion of total Notch signaling triggered a severe systemic B-lymphoproliferative disorder, causing death. RBP-j is the DNA binding partner of Notch, but both RBP-j-dependent and independent Notch signaling were necessary for proper epidermal differentiation and lipid deposition. Loss of both pathways caused a persistent defect in skin differentiation/barrier formation. In response, high levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) were released into systemic circulation by Notch-deficient keratinocytes that failed to differentiate, starting in utero. Exposure to high TSLP levels during neonatal hematopoiesis resulted in drastic expansion of peripheral pre- and immature B-lymphocytes, causing B-lymphoproliferative disorder associated with major organ infiltration and subsequent death, a previously unappreciated systemic effect of TSLP. These observations demonstrate that local skin perturbations can drive a lethal systemic disease and have important implications for a wide range of humoral and autoimmune diseases with skin manifestations.;Autoimmune diabetes in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model results from a breakdown of T-cell tolerance caused by impaired tolerogenic dendritic cell development and regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation. Re-establishment of the Treg pool has been shown to confer T-cell tolerance and protection against diabetes. Here, we have investigated whether murine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) re-established tolerogenic function of dendritic cells and induced differentiation and/or expansion of Tregs in NOD mice and protection against diabetes.\nWe examined the phenotype of TSLP-conditioned bone marrow dendritic cells (TSLP-DCs) of NOD mice and their functions to induce noninflammatory Th2 response and differentiation of Tregs. The functional relevance of TSLP and TSLP-DCs to development of diabetes was also tested.\nOur results showed that bone marrow dendritic cells of NOD mice cultured in the presence of TSLP acquired signatures of tolerogenic dendritic cells, such as an absence of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decreased expression of dendritic cell costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex class II) compared with LPS-treated dendritic cells. Furthermore, TSLP-DCs promoted noninflammatory Th2 response and induced the conversion of naïve T-cells into functional CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs. We further showed that subcutaneous injections of TSLP for 6 days or a single intravenous injection of TSLP-DCs protected NOD mice against diabetes.\nOur study demonstrates that TSLP re-established a tolerogenic immune response in NOD mice and protects from diabetes, suggesting that TSLP may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.;Epithelial cell-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a master switch for asthma or atopic dermatitis by inducing a dendritic cell-mediated Th2-type allergic inflammation. Allergic rhinitis is also pathologically characterized by Th2-type allergic inflammation. This study demonstrates that mast cells regulate the epithelial TSLP expression in allergic rhinitis. TSLP expression was found to be up-regulated predominantly in the nasal epithelium in the ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -nasally challenged mouse model of allergic rhinitis, which was abolished in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/W(v) in comparison with control WBB6F1-+/+ mice. Similarly, the epithelial TSLP expression was reduced in Fc receptor gamma chain (FcgammaR)-deficient mice, where the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) is not expressed on mast cells, in comparison with control C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, the administration of neutralizing TSLP antibody during the challenge phase of OVA inhibited the development of allergic rhinitis. These results suggest that the direct stimulation of epithelial cells by antigens alone may not be sufficient to induce TSLP expression in the nasal epithelium, and that mast cell regulation of epithelial TSLP expression, possibly via FcepsilonRI, plays an important role in the development of allergic rhinitis.;Airway epithelial cells provide mechanical and immune protection against pathogens and allergens. Following activation, these cells produce a wide range of cytokines including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Recently it was established that a high level of TSLP is associated with asthma in mice and in humans. These findings suggest that interfering with the ability of cells to respond to TSLP might prevent the development of airway inflammation. Our review presents current knowledge on mediators that induce TSLP production and on the actions of TSLP on different populations of cells that are related to airway inflammation. TSLP affects dendritic cells, T cells, NKT cells, and mast cells, indicative of the broad role of TSLP in the regulation of inflammatory/allergic processes.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an IL-7-related cytokine, is widely expressed by epithelial cells in many tissues with different biological effects. Human TSLP (hTSLP) has been shown to play an important role in promoting T cell homeostasis, developing nondeletional central tolerance, amplifying epithelium-induced class switching, inducing atopic diseases and maintaining intestinal noninflammatory environment. Among diverse cells responding to hTSLP, dendritic cells (DCs) are the most obviously characterized target cells. In this review, we attempt to outline an effect of the functional versatility of hTSLP-activated DCs (hTSLP-DCs) on T cells.;Chitin and chitosan have versatile anti-tumor, anti-fungal, and antimicrobial biological properties. Oral intakes and intranasal administration of chitin attenuated allergen-induced airway inflammation in sensitized mice, which may be due to its Th1 adjuvant properties. However, their mechanism of action is not entirely clear. In this report, we demonstrate that water-soluble chitosan (WSC) has specific immunomodulatory effects on dust mite allergen Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f)-stimulated, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). These effects include polarizing the cytokine balance towards Th1 cytokines, decreasing the production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha, down-regulating CD44 and TLR4 receptor expression, and inhibiting T cell proliferation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination found that WSC reduced the rate of pseudopodia formation in Der f-stimulated MDM from allergic asthma patients. The effect of WSC on allergen-stimulated MDM may be mediated via inhibition of PKCzeta phosphorylation and NF-kappaB pathway activation. In a murine model of asthma, we found that intranasal application of WSC attenuates Der f-induced lung inflammation by reducing infiltration of inflammatory cells, epithelial damage, and goblet cell hyperplasia and markedly decreasing production of Arg I, iNOs, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in the bronchial epithelium. Therefore, we believe that WSC may provide a new therapeutic modality for allergic asthma.;Toll-like receptors (TLR) classically recognize pathogen-associated danger signals but are also activated via endogenous ligands. For evaluation of their role in inflammatory kidney disease, the function of TLR was analyzed in two mouse models of cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN; mice transgenic for thymic stromal lymphopoietin [TSLP], with or without deletion of the Fcgamma receptor IIb). Expression of TLR1 through 9 and TLR11 mRNA was detectable in whole kidneys and in isolated glomeruli of wild-type mice, with TLR3 and TLR4 having the highest absolute levels of expression. TLR1, 2, and 4 were increased in TSLP transgenic mice and even higher in TSLP transgenic FcgammaRIIb-deficient mice. TLR5 through 9 and 11 were upregulated to similar degrees in TSLP transgenic and TSLP transgenic FcgammaRIIb-deficient mice. Immunohistochemical studies of nephritic glomeruli localized TLR4 protein to podocytes. Cultured podocytes also expressed TLR4, and stimulation with TLR4-specific ligands resulted in a marked induction of chemokines; this was reduced by specific knockdown of TLR4 with siRNA. Fibrinogen, a potential endogenous TLR4 ligand, was shown to induce a similar profile of chemokines. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that TLR4 is constitutively expressed by podocytes and is upregulated in MPGN, where it may mediate glomerular injury by modulating expression of chemokines; therefore, TLR4 may link podocytes with the innate immune system to mediate MPGN triggered by the deposition of immune complexes.;The basis for gender influences on allergen-specific IgEs is unclear.\nTo perform regular and sex-stratified genomewide linkage analyses of IgE to each of three allergens (Ascaris lumbricoides, Blatella germanica [German cockroach]), and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [dust mite]) and to conduct an association study of a candidate gene in a linked genomic region.\nGenomewide linkage analyses of allergen-specific IgEs were conducted in 653 members of eight large families of Costa Rican children with asthma. An analysis of the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IgE measurements was conducted in 417 parent-child trios in Costa Rica. Significant results were replicated in 470 families of white children in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP).\nAmong all subjects, there was suggestive evidence of linkage (LOD >/= 2.72) to IgE to Ascaris (on chromosome 7q) and IgE to dust mite (on chromosomes 7p and 12q). In a sex-stratified analysis, there was significant evidence of linkage to IgE to cockroach on chromosome 5q23 (peak LOD, 4.14 at 127 cM) in female subjects. TSLP is located within the 1.5 LOD-unit support interval for this linkage peak and has female-specific effects on lung disease in mice. In a sex-stratified analysis, the T allele of single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2289276 in TSLP was associated with reductions in IgE to cockroach (in Costa Rican girls) and total IgE (in girls in Costa Rica and in CAMP; P value for sex-by-genotype interaction, <0.01 in both studies).\nConsistent with findings in murine models, a variant in TSLP may have female-specific effects on allergic phenotypes.;Despite the growing number of studies using Lorenz (Poincaré) plots (LPs) for the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), a possible correlation between the underlying ECG waveforms and the RR scatter plots has never been systematically studied. We report a comprehensive investigation of distinct Lorenz plot patterns (LPPs) encountered in the context of major cardiac tachyarrhythmias as assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring and detail the mechanisms underlying the specific LPPs.\nThe 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms (AECGs) of 2700 patients with atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias and the AECGs of 200 controls with pure sinus rhythm were analyzed using an Elatec arrhythmia analyzing system (Elamedical, Paris 1996). This system allows for the generation of two-dimensional LPs and the exploration of the underlying ECG waveforms. Each LPP obtained was categorized according to its shape and basic geometric parameters. In accordance with the most characteristic LPP feature, the LPPs were grouped into the following distinct classes: 1) comet shape; 2) torpedo shape; 3) H-Fan shape; 4) SZ-Fan shape; 5) double side lobe pattern type A (DSLP-A); 6) double side lobe pattern type B (DSL-B); 7) triple side lobe pattern type A (TSLP-A); 8) triple side lobe pattern type B (TSLP-B);9 island pattern type A (IP-A); 10) island pattern type B (IP-B).\nWhile a comet or a torpedo shape was associated with sinus rhythms, the other LPPs were specifically linked to the presence of cardiac tachyarrhythmias. Thus, a Fan shape was associated with atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia, whereas a DSLP indicated the presence of atrial premature beats, and a TSLP was highly specifically linked to frequent ventricular premature beats. An island pattern was exclusively associated with the presence of an atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 100%).\nMajor tachyarrhythmias imprint specific patterns on two-dimensional Lorenz plots generated from 24-hour Holter recordings. Thus, the Lorenz plot method has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of arrhythmia detection and differentiation, particularly with respect to supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin (IL)-7-like cytokine produced by epithelial cells and triggers dendritic cell-mediated Th2 type allergic inflammatory responses. This study investigated whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly-IC affect TSLP production in synovial fibroblasts. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that LPS and poly-IC upregulated TSLP production in synovial fibroblasts obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, we found that nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibitor IMD-0354, dexamethasone, and interferon (IFN)-gamma inhibited the LPS- and poly-IC-induced TSLP production in RA and OA synovial fibroblasts. Thus, LPS and poly-IC can upregulate TSLP via a NF-kappaB pathway in synovial fibroblasts, which is downregulated by dexamethasone and interferon (IFN)-gamma. The current findings suggest that TSLP may be involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory arthritis as well as allergic disease.;Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of atopy have shed light on potential targets for the development of new therapies for allergic diseases. In this issue of the JCI, Seshasayee et al. provide direct in vivo evidence that OX40 has critical roles in allergic inflammation mediated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) (see the related article beginning on page 3868). Blockade of interactions between OX40 on Th2 cells and OX40 ligand (OX40L) on TSLP-activated DCs using an OX40L-specific monoclonal antibody, inhibited Th2 cell-mediated immune responses in both mouse and nonhuman primate models of allergic inflammation. The results point to potential therapeutic approaches to targeting the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying TSLP-mediated allergic inflammation.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) potently induces deregulation of Th2 responses, a hallmark feature of allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. However, direct downstream in vivo mediators in the TSLP-induced atopic immune cascade have not been identified. In our current study, we have shown that OX40 ligand (OX40L) is a critical in vivo mediator of TSLP-mediated Th2 responses. Treating mice with OX40L-blocking antibodies substantially inhibited immune responses induced by TSLP in the lung and skin, including Th2 inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine secretion, and IgE production. OX40L-blocking antibodies also inhibited antigen-driven Th2 inflammation in mouse and nonhuman primate models of asthma. This treatment resulted in both blockade of the OX40-OX40L receptor-ligand interaction and depletion of OX40L-positive cells. The use of a blocking, OX40L-specific mAb thus presents a promising strategy for the treatment of allergic diseases associated with pathologic Th2 immune responses.;Although several cytokines have been demonstrated to be critical regulators of development of multiple blood cell lineages, it remains disputed to what degree they act through instructive or permissive mechanisms. Signaling through the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor and the hematopoietin IL-7 receptor alpha (IL-7Ralpha) has been demonstrated to be of critical importance for sustained thymopoiesis. Signaling triggered by IL-7 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is dependent on IL-7Ralpha, and both ligands have been implicated in T-cell development. However, we demonstrate that, whereas thymopoiesis is abolished in adult mice doubly deficient in IL-7 and FLT3 ligand (FLT3L), TSLP does not play a key role in IL-7-independent or FLT3L-independent T lymphopoiesis. Furthermore, whereas previous studies implicated that the role of other cytokine tyrosine kinase receptors in T lymphopoiesis might not involve permissive actions, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of BCL2 is sufficient not only to partially correct the T-cell phenotype of Flt3l(-/-) mice but also to rescue the virtually complete loss of all discernable stages of early T lymphopoiesis in Flt3l(-/-)Il7r(-/-) mice. These findings implicate a permissive role of cytokine receptors of the hematopoietin and tyrosine kinase families in early T lymphopoiesis.;Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) activates dendritic cells (DCs), which promote the proliferation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells. However, murine TSLP (mTSLP) can act directly on CD4+ T cells and bring about their differentiation. We studied the role of mTSLP in the generation of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells from thymocytes. mTSLP promoted the differentiation of CD4+ single-positive thymocytes into CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells. Although we cannot exclude an effect of TSLP mediated through DCs due to co-stimulatory effects, mTSLP appears to act directly on thymocytes. T-cell receptor and TSLP receptor signaling act synergistically on thymocytes to generate CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells. mTSLP may play an important role in maintaining immune tolerance by promoting the conversion of thymocytes into natural regulatory T cells via escape from negative selection.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-TSLP receptor (TSLP-R) interactions activate CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and increase epithelial cell Th2-type cytokine production. We detected intracellular TSLP expression on CK7(+) trophoblast cells and TSLP-R expression on placental DCs from pregnant BALB/cxC57BL/6 and NOD/SCIDxC57BL/6 mice on gestational day 12.5. Murine recombinant TSLP activated DCs from BALB/c mice, with increased CD80 and CD83 expressions; TSLP-activated DCs induced IL-10-producing NK cell expansion. This was abrogated by anti-TSLP Ab or by culturing CD49b(+) NK cells alone. No TSLP-DC-induced IL-10(+)CD49b(+) cell expansion occurred when DCs and CD49b(+) cells were cultured separately. Although TSLP-induced DC activation occurred in NOD/SCID mice, the IL-10(+) NK cell percentage was unchanged. CK7(+) trophoblast cells may activate placental DCs via a TSLP-TSLP-R interaction and induce DC-dependent placental NK cell IL-10 production. TSLP-DC and NK cell contact appears necessary for IL-10(+)CD49b(+) cell expansion. Placental NK cells from NOD/SCIDxC57BL/6 mice appear less sensitive to TSLP-DC induction.;To explore the mechanism of signal transduction in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in bronchial epithelial cells.\nThe eukaryotic expression vector of RSV F protein, pcDNA3-F, was constructed and transfected into in vitro cultured human bronchial epithelial cell line CRL-9483, which was also transfected with Smad7 expression vector pcDNA3/Smad7 or exposed to p38, ERK1/2, JNK, and JAK/STAT1 inhibitors. The mRNA levels of TSLP and the housekeeping GAPDH gene were analyzed 24 h later with semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In cells with downregulated TSLP mRNA expression due to the addition of the signal inhibitors, cytoplasm TSLP or GAPDH protein levels were further analyzed using Western blotting.\nVirtually no TSLP mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR in cultured CRL-9483 cells transfected with pcDNA3 exclusively (TSLP/GAPDH relative total gray scale of 0.10-/+0.03), while cell transfection with pcDNA3-F resulted in significantly increased TSLP mRNA level (0.42-/+0.20, P=0.024). In the presence of F protein expression, both p38 and JNK inhibitors could downregulate TSLP mRNA levels (0.14-/+0.04, P=0.036; 0.23-/+0.07, P=0.048, respectively), while TGF-beta-Smad inhibiting protein Smad7 (0.60-/+0.25), ERK 1/2 inhibitor (0.45-/+0.23), and JAK/STAT1inhibitor (0.44-/+0.25) failed to block TSLP expression (P>0.05). Western blotting showed that p38 inhibitor (TSLP/GAPDH relative total gray scale=3.67-/+1.18, P=0.018) and JNK inhibitor (1.48-/+0.77, P=0.004) also downregulated the protein levels of TSLP as compared with pcDNA3-F transfection group (8.13-/+2.20).\nRSV F protein can stimulate TSLP expression in human bronchial epithelial cells mediated partially by p38 and JNK signal pathways.;Understanding the pathogenesis of leukemia in the context of lymphopoiesis may reveal novel therapeutic targets. Previously, we have shown that mTOR inhibitors (MTI) show activity in vitro and in preclinical models of both human and murine precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL), inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. These MTI-mediated effects can be reversed by interleukin-7 (IL-7), an important regulator of early B-cell development. This observation led us to examine the contribution of signaling via the IL-7Ralpha chain, which is shared by the receptor complexes of IL-7 and thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP is closely related to IL-7 and active in lymphopoiesis, but an effect of TSLP on leukemia cells has not been described. We examined the effect of TSLP on pre-B ALL cells and their response to MTIs. Here, we show that TSLP stimulates proliferation of pre-B ALL cell lines. TSLP also partially reverses the effects of MTI on proliferation, apoptosis, and ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in cell lines, with similar biological effects seen in some primary human lymphoblast samples. These data show that TSLP can promote survival of pre-B ALL cells and antagonize the effects of MTIs. These findings suggest that IL-7Ralpha chain is responsible for transducing the survival signal that overcomes MTI-mediated growth inhibition in pre-B ALL. Thus, further exploration of the IL-7Ralpha pathway may identify potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of ALL. Our data illustrate that growth-factor-mediated signaling may provide one mechanism of MTI resistance.;It has become increasingly clear that airway epithelial cells are central participants in innate and adaptive immune responses as well as mucosal inflammation. Epithelial cells produce antimicrobial host defense molecules, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to activation via pathogen recognition receptors. Recruitment of immune cells including dendritic cells, T cells and B cells into the proximity of epithelium results in the enhancement of adaptive immunity through interactions with epithelial cells. Newly identified epithelial-derived cytokines, including TSLP, IL-33 and BAFF, help to shape the local accumulation and activation of Th2 responses and B cell immunoglobulin production. Epithelial cells are also downstream targets of molecules that activate IL-13R and EGFR and are responsible for mucus production in both protective immune responses and allergic airway inflammatory diseases. Improved understanding of epithelial immune and inflammatory responses will hopefully suggest new strategies for therapeutic intervention.;17875281'};The prevalence of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic diseases has been increasing for the last four decades. In this review determinants for an increased IgE synthesis are discussed on both an epidemiological and on an immunological level with special emphasis on the differentiation of the B cell to an IgE-producing plasma cell. Factors that favor an IgE immune response are low antigen doses and immunization via mucous membranes, but it is highly likely that other environmental factors besides exposure to the allergenic sources play a role. Important factors in the formation of the Thelper type 2 (Th2) T cell subset are the actions of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) on dendritic cells and the OX40 ligand on CD4+ T cells. In order for a B lymphocyte to switch to IgE production it needs two signals provided by a Th2 cell in the form of the cytokines interleukin (IL-) 4/IL-13 and ligation of the CD40. In spite of a half-life of only a few days, there is evidence that the IgE response may last for years even without allergen stimulation. This is likely to be caused by long-lived IgE-producing plasma cells, and such cells may be difficult to target therapeutically thus emphasizing the need for more knowledge on preventable causes of IgE- and allergy development.;17712336'};Interleukin 7 (IL-7) plays a crucial role in adult lymphopoiesis, while in fetal life its effect can be partially compensated by TSLP. Whether adult hematopoietic progenitor cells are unresponsive to TSLP or whether TSLP is less available in adult microenvironments is still a matter of debate. Here, we show that increased TSLP availability through transgene (Tg) expression fully restored lymphopoiesis in IL-7-deficient mice: it rescued B-cell development, increased thymic and splenic cellularities, and restored double-negative (DN) thymocytes, alphabeta and gammadelta T-cell generation, and all peripheral lymphoid compartments. Analysis of bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor cells from adult wild-type mice efficiently differentiated toward B- and T-cell lineages in lethally irradiated IL-7 deficient mice provided TSLP Tg was expressed in these mice. In vitro, TSLP promoted the differentiation of uncommitted adult bone marrow progenitors toward B and T lineages and the further differentiation of DN1 and DN2 thymocytes. Altogether, our results show that adult hematopoietic cells are TSLP responsive and that TSLP can sustain long-term adult lymphopoiesis.;Culturing the human natural killer cell line NK-92 for 24 h in the presence of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) potentiated its cytotoxic capacity against the erythroleukemia cell line K562. Longer incubation times did not augment the NK activity any further. No synergistic effects with respect to either proliferation or cytotoxicity were observed when TSLP was mixed with suboptimal concentrations of IL-2. FACS analysis of the NK-92 cells indicated expression of TSLPR but not the other component of the TSLP receptor complex, namely IL-7Ralpha. Some of the surface molecules known to be involved in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity were also monitored. None of the receptors analyzed altered their expression to any major extent upon culture in TSLP or IL-2. However, a limited number of NK-92 cells were observed that had a rather low CD94/NKG2A expression, which increased upon stimulation with TSLP or IL-2.;Transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) develop mixed cryoglobulinaemia with renal disease closely resembling human cryoglobulinaemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), as well as systemic inflammation involving lung, liver and skin as a result of cryoglobulin deposits. We assessed the effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, on this model of cryoglobulinaemic MPGN.\nGroups of male TSLP tg mice and wild-type controls were treated with either ATRA (20 mg/kg) or vehicle 3 times weekly by intraperitoneal injection for 4 or 8 weeks, when mice were then sacrificed. Routine histology and immunohistochemistry for collagen IV, alpha-smooth muscle actin, Mac-2 and Ki67 were performed. Immunoglobulin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nATRA unexpectedly exacerbated renal injury in TSLP tg mice with increased glomerular extracellular matrix, mesangial cell activation, glomerular cell proliferation, glomerular macrophage influx and immune complex deposition. Systemic injuries involving liver and lung, and the amount of circulating cryoglobulins were all worsened by ATRA treatment. Furthermore, ATRA resulted in increased IgG1 and IgM levels, the main components of the cryoglobulins in TSLP tg mice, and a manifestation of an enhanced Th2 immune response.\nATRA is not protective but instead aggravates cryoglobulinaemic MPGN and its systemic manifestations in TSLP tg mice. We speculate these findings may be due to augmented production of pathogenic immunoglobulins and/or an enhanced systemic Th2 response. Although disappointing, our results also suggest caution in the application of retinoid therapy to human disease based on the largely positive animal data reported to date.;It was demonstrated 5 years ago that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a IL-7-like cytokine produced by epithelial cells, could strongly activate human myeloid dendritic cells to induce an inflammatory T(H)2 response characterized by high TNF-alpha and little IL-10 production, distinct from the regulatory T(H)2 responses characterized by low TNF-alpha and high IL-10 production. TSLP was found highly expressed by keratinocytes of skin lesions of atopic dermatitis and associated with dendritic cell activation in situ. This suggests for the first time that TSLP represents a master switch of allergic inflammation at the epithelial cell and dendritic cell interface. During the last several years, the evidence for the association of TSLP with human asthma was revealed. The direct link between TSLP expression with the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and asthma in vivo was demonstrated. In addition, OX40 ligand was found to be the TSLP-induced molecule on dendritic cells that triggers inflammatory T(H)2 differentiation in the absence of IL-12. TSLP was also demonstrated to direct the innate phase of allergic immune responses through activating mast cells. Therefore, TSLP and OX40 ligand may represent important targets for intervention of the initiation of allergic inflammatory responses.;Humans and other mammals coexist with a diverse array of microbes colonizing the intestine, termed the microflora. The relationship is symbiotic, with the microbes benefiting from a stable environment and nutrient supply, and the host gaining competitive exclusion of pathogens and continuously maintenance of the gut immune homeostasis. Here we report novel crosstalk mechanisms between the human enterocyte cell line, Caco2, and underlying human monocyte-derived DC in a transwell model where Gram-positive (G+) commensals prevent Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)-dependent Escherichia coli-induced semimaturation in a TLR2-dependent fashion. These findings add to our understanding of the hypo-responsiveness of the gut epithelium towards the microflora. Gut DC posses a more tolerogenic phenotype than conventional DC. Here we show that Caco2 spent medium (SM) induces tolerogenic DC with lower expression of maturation markers, interleukin (IL)-12p70, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha when matured with G+ and Gram-negative (G-) commensals, while IL-10 production is enhanced in DC upon encountering G+ commensals and reduced upon encountering G- bacteria. The Caco2 SM-induced tolerogenic phenotype is also seen in DC priming of naive T cells with elevated levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and markedly reduced levels of bacteria-induced interferon-gamma production. Caco2 cell production of IL-8, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and TGF-beta increases upon microbial stimulation in a strain dependent manner. TSLP and TGF-beta co-operate in inducing the tolerogenic DC phenotype but other mediators might be involved.;Asthma is an inflammatory lung disease, in which CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells play an important pathogenic role. Also, recent reports indicated that a cytokine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), is essential for the development of antigen-induced asthma. Here we examined the relationship between NKT cells and TSLP in a mouse model of asthma. NKT cells express TSLP receptor as well as IL-7 receptor alpha-chain. TSLP acts on NKT cells to preferentially increase their IL-13 production but not IFN-gamma and IL-4. In an allergen-induced asthma model, the development of airway hyperreactivity, a cardinal feature of asthma, was increased in TSLP transgenic mice, whereas this effect was not observed in TSLP transgenic mice lacking NKT cells. Interestingly, in the NKT cell-lacking TSLP transgenic mice, pulmonary eosinophilia and increase in IgE did not improve. Pulmonary lymphocytes from the NKT cell-lacking TSLP transgenic mice produced much less IL-13 upon CD3 stimulation than those from NKT cell-competent TSLP transgenic mice. These resultssuggest that, in allergen-induced asthma, TSLP acts on NKT cells to enhance airway hyperreactivity by upregulating their IL-13 production, whereas eosinophilia and IgE production are not influenced.;Thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin (TSLP) is preferentially and highly expressed in the thymus, but its function in T cell development is not clear.\nWe report here that TSLP, independently or in combination with IL-7, enhances thymopoiesis in the murine fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC) model. Furthermore, TSLP preferentially increases the number and proliferation of the (DN1 and DN2) pro-T progenitor cells, and FTOC lobes from TSLP receptor-null mice show a decreased number of these cells. Finally, DN1-DN2 cells expanded with TSLP in vitro are functional T progenitors that are able to differentiate into mature T cells in fetal or adult thymus organs.\nTogether, these data suggest that TSLP plays an important role in expansion of thymocyte progenitors and may be of value for expanding T progenitor cells in vitro.;Interleukin (IL) 25 (IL-17E), a distinct member of the IL-17 cytokine family, plays important roles in evoking T helper type 2 (Th2) cell-mediated inflammation that features the infiltrations of eosinophils and Th2 memory cells. However, the cellular sources, target cells, and underlying mechanisms remain elusive in humans. We demonstrate that human Th2 memory cells expressing distinctive levels of IL-25 receptor (R) are one of the responding cell types. IL-25 promotes cell expansion and Th2 cytokine production when Th2 central memory cells are stimulated with thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-activated dendritic cells (DCs), homeostatic cytokines, or T cell receptor for antigen triggering. The enhanced functions of Th2 memory cells induced by IL-25 are associated with sustained expression of GATA-3, c-MAF, and JunB in an IL-4-independent manner. Although keratinocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils express IL-25 transcripts, activated eosinophils and basophils from normal and atopic subjects were found to secrete bioactive IL-25 protein, which augments the functions of Th2 memory cells. Elevated expression of IL-25 and IL-25R transcripts was observed in asthmatic lung tissues and atopic dermatitis skin lesions, linking their possible roles with exacerbated allergic disorders. Our results provide a plausible explanation that IL-25 produced by innate effector eosinophils and basophils may augment the allergic inflammation by enhancing the maintenance and functions of adaptive Th2 memory cells.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is elevated in asthma and triggers dendritic cell-mediated activation of Th2 inflammatory responses. Although TSLP has been shown to be produced mainly by airway epithelial cells, the regulation of epithelial TSLP expression has not been extensively studied. We investigated the expression of TSLP in cytokine- or TLR ligand-treated normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). The mRNA for TSLP was significantly up-regulated by stimulation with IL-4 (5.5-fold) and IL-13 (5.3-fold), weakly up-regulated by TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, and IFN-beta, and not affected by IFN-gamma in NHBE. TSLP mRNA was only significantly up-regulated by the TLR3 ligand (dsRNA) among the TLR ligands tested (66.8-fold). TSLP was also induced by in vitro infection with rhinovirus. TSLP protein was detected after stimulation with dsRNA (120 +/- 23 pg/ml). The combination of TNF-alpha and IL-4 produced detectable levels of TSLP protein (40 +/- 13 pg/ml). In addition, TSLP was synergistically enhanced by a combination of IL-4 and dsRNA (mRNA; 207-fold, protein; 325 +/- 75 pg/ml). The induction of TSLP by dsRNA was dependent upon NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) signaling via TLR3 as indicated by a study with small interfering RNA. The potent topical glucocorticoid fluticasone propionate significantly suppressed dsRNA-dependent TSLP production in NHBE. These results suggest that the expression of TSLP is induced in airway epithelial cells by stimulation with the TLR3 ligand and Th2 cytokines and that this response is suppressed by glucocorticoid treatment. This implies that respiratory viral infection and the recruitment of Th2 cytokine producing cells may amplify Th2 inflammation via the induction of TSLP in the asthmatic airway.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that promotes CD4(+) T cell homeostasis and contributes to allergic and inflammatory responses. TSLP can act directly on mouse CD4(+) T cells, but in humans, the available data have indicated that TSLP receptors are not expressed on CD4(+) T cells and that TSLP instead activates dendritic cells, which in turn promote the proliferation and differentiation of CD4(+) T cells. We now unexpectedly demonstrate the presence of TSLP receptors on activated human CD4(+) T cells. Strikingly, whereas freshly isolated peripheral blood human T cells show little if any response to TSLP, TCR stimulation allows a potent response to this cytokine. Moreover, TSLP increases the sensitivity of human CD4(+) T cells to low doses of IL-2, augmenting responsiveness of these cells to TCR engagement. Our results establish that human CD4(+) T cells are direct targets for TSLP.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a novel cytokine that triggers dendritic cell-mediated T helper (Th)-2 inflammatory responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC) play a critical role in initiating or perpetuating airway inflammation by producing chemokines and cytokines. In this study, we first evaluated the expression of TSLP in primary HASMC and investigated how proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and Th-2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-9) regulate TSLP production from HASMC. TSLP mRNA and protein were assessed by real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence from primary HASMC cultures. Primary HASMC express constitutive level of TSLP. Incubation of HASMC with IL-1 or TNF-alpha resulted in a significant increase of TSLP mRNA and protein release from HASMC. Furthermore, combination of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha has an additive effect on TSLP release by HASMC. Primary HASMC pretreated with inhibitors of p38 or p42/p44 ERK MAPK, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, showed a significant decrease in TSLP release on IL-1beta and TNF-alpha treatment. Furthermore, TSLP immunoreactivity was present in ASM bundle from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to lesser degree in normal subjects. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence of IL-1beta- and TNF-alpha-induced TSLP expression in HASMC via (p38, p42/p44) MAPK signaling pathways. Our results raise the possibility that HASMC may play a role in COPD airway inflammation via TSLP-dependent pathway.;The past several years have seen an increase in the rate at which genes that are associated with allergic asthma and eczema are discovered. This review -examines genetic association, gene expression, and functional studies that have identified genes that are expressed in the epithelial cells of the skin and lung and are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma and eczema. This includes the genes encoding thymic stromal lympho-poietin (TSLP) and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3) that are involved in the activation of T-helper 2 cells, the microbial pattern recognition receptors nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) genes (CARD4 and CARD15), Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4), and filaggrin, a protein required for effective barrier defense of the skin. Therefore, the development of allergic disease involves both the adaptive and innate immune systems, and the expression of these genes in the skin and lungs suggests a link to environmental -triggers at body surfaces.;Thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP) and interleukin-7 share a common receptor chain, IL-7Ralpha. IL-7 is involved in T-cell homeostasis, and TSLP induces production of pro-allergic cytokines. The gene encoding the IL-7Ralpha chain is polymorphic, and investigation of inhalation allergic patients compared with controls showed significant association with two alleles at position +1237 and +2087.;Asthma and atopic dermatitis are epithelial disorders in which T helper 2 (Th2)-type inflammation has a prominent role. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine produced by the skin and airway epithelium that is capable of directing dendritic cells towards a Th2 response, thereby providing an essential link between epithelial cell activation and allergic-type inflammation. In addition, TSLP can interact directly with mast cells to initiate Th2 cytokine production to also provide a non-T cell route to mediate its pro-allergic effects. Induction of TSLP production occurs through the activation of epithelial Toll-like receptors to provide an important new link between innate immunity and allergic disease.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an IL-7-like cytokine that triggers dendritic cell-mediated Th2-type inflammatory responses and is considered as a master switch for allergic inflammation. In this study, we found increased levels of TSLP and, also TNF-alpha as previously reported, in synovial fluid specimens derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when compared with those from patients with osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, TNF-alpha up-regulated TSLP expression in RA- and OA-derived synovial fibroblasts, which was inhibited by IFN-gamma. Furthermore, anti-TSLP neutralizing antibody ameliorated a TNF-alpha-dependent experimental arthritis induced by anti-type II collagen antibody in mice. Collectively, these results suggest that TSLP, as a downstream molecule of TNF-alpha, may be involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory arthritis. TSLP might thus play a role not only in allergic diseases but also in inflammatory arthritis such as RA.;17401368'};Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that strongly activates dendritic cells (DC) and can initiate allergic inflammation. The factors inducing the production of human TSLP are not known. In this study, we show that proinflammatory (TNF-alpha or IL-1alpha) and Th2 (IL-4 or IL-13) cytokines synergized to induce the production of TSLP in human skin explants. TSLP production in situ was restricted to epidermal keratinocytes of the suprabasal layer. TSLP production could not be inhibited by factors regulating Th2 inflammation, such as IL-10, TGF-beta, or IFN-gamma. Cytokine-treated skin culture supernatants induced the maturation of blood CD11c(+) DC in a TSLP-dependent manner. Our data provide the first evidence of TSLP induction and subsequent DC activation in human skin. Blocking TSLP-inducing cytokines could represent a novel strategy for the treatment of allergic diseases.;Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia in humans is strongly associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. It remains controversial whether liver injury in hepatitis C is primarily attributable to direct viral cytopathic effect or to an immune-mediated response. We characterized the role of cryoglobulinemia in the development of liver disease in thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) transgenic mice that produce mixed cryoglobulinemia and develop hepatitis. The role of immune complexes in this animal model was evaluated using techniques of light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. To assess the role of Fc receptor engagement in mediation of the disease, TSLP transgenic mice were crossbred with mice deficient for immunoglobulin-binding receptor gamma IIb (FcgammaRIIb). Livers from the TSLP transgenic animals showed mild to moderate liver injury, minimal to mild fibrosis, and deposition of immunoglobulin around the portal tracts. TSLP transgenic mice deficient in inhibitory FcgammaRIIb had more severe hepatitis and accelerated mortality. TSLP-associated hepatitis bears strong similarity to hepatitis C virus-related hepatitis as it occurs in humans, making this a valuable model system of chronic hepatitis and fibrosis to study therapies aimed at manipulating immune responses. Periportal immune complex deposition may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis occurring in the setting of systemic cryoglobulinemia.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) endows human CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) from peripheral blood with  the capacity to induce proallergic T cells. TSLP is present at high levels in the epidermis of atopic dermatitis where it appears to trigger emigration of epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs); however, nothing else is known about the influence of TSLP on LCs.\nEffects of TSLP on human epidermal LCs were investigated.\nLCs were isolated by trypsinization from healthy human skin, highly enriched by immunomagnetic techniques (via CD1a) and cultured for 2 days. Additionally, migratory LCs were obtained by emigration from epidermal sheets for 3 days.\nThe addition of TSLP promoted survival and maturation of LCs obtained by trypsinization, as indicated by their increased expression of CD83, CD86, and high levels of MHC II. TSLP markedly increased numbers of migratory LCs. Allogeneic naïve CD4(+) T cells, cocultured with migratory TSLP-LCs produced less IFN-gamma and IL-10 and more IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-alpha. Finally, TSLP-LCs secreted markedly more of the T(H)2 T-cell-attracting chemokine CCL17/thymus and activation-regulated chemokine.\nThese cytokine patterns correspond to those described for TSLP-treated blood DCs. They highlight a direct effect of TSLP on epidermal LCs.\nOur data emphasize a critical role for LCs in the triggering of atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, they underscore the interest in TSLP as a potential therapeutic target in atopic diseases.;There has been a worldwide increase in allergy and asthma over the last few decades, particularly in industrially developed nations. This resulted in a renewed interest to understand the pathogenesis of allergy in recent years. The progress made in the pathogenesis of allergic disease has led to the exploration of novel alternative therapies, which include herbal medicines as well. Curcumin, present in turmeric, a frequently used spice in Asia has been shown to have anti-allergic and inflammatory potential.\nWe used a murine model of latex allergy to investigate the role of curcumin as an immunomodulator. BALB/c mice were exposed to latex allergens and developed latex allergy with a Th2 type of immune response. These animals were treated with curcumin and the immunological and inflammatory responses were evaluated.\nAnimals exposed to latex showed enhanced serum IgE, latex specific IgG1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, eosinophils and inflammation in the lungs. Intragastric treatment of latex-sensitized mice with curcumin demonstrated a diminished Th2 response with a concurrent reduction in lung inflammation. Eosinophilia in curcumin-treated mice was markedly reduced, co-stimulatory molecule expression (CD80, CD86, and OX40L) on antigen-presenting cells was decreased, and expression of MMP-9, OAT, and TSLP genes was also attenuated.\nThese results suggest that curcumin has potential therapeutic value for controlling allergic responses resulting from exposure to allergens.;Compelling evidence suggests that the epithelial cell-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) may initiate asthma or atopic dermatitis through a dendritic cell-mediated T helper (Th)2 response. Here, we describe how TSLP might initiate and aggravate allergic inflammation in the absence of T lymphocytes and immunoglobulin E antibodies via the innate immune system. We show that TSLP, synergistically with interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor, stimulates the production of high levels of Th2 cytokines by human mast cells (MCs). We next report that TSLP is released by primary epithelial cells in response to certain microbial products, physical injury, or inflammatory cytokines. Direct epithelial cell-mediated, TSLP-dependent activation of MCs may play a central role in ""intrinsic"" forms of atopic diseases and explain the aggravating role of infection and scratching in these diseases.;The cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been implicated in the development and progression of allergic inflammation in both humans and mice. Although the underlying mechanism is not known, TSLP-stimulated dendritic cells have been shown to prime human CD4(+) T cells into Th2 cytokine-producing cells. However, its direct effect on CD4(+) T cells has not been extensively investigated. In this study, we show that TSLP can drive Th2 differentiation in the absence of exogenous IL-4 and APCs. IL-4 blockade inhibited TSLP-mediated Th2 differentiation, demonstrating that IL-4 is involved in this process. Further analysis has shown that TSLP-induced Th2 differentiation is dependent on Stat6 and independent of IL-2 and that TSLP treatment leads to immediate, direct Il-4 gene transcription. Taken together, these data demonstrate that TSLP is directly involved in Th2-mediated responses via the induction of IL-4 production.;The epithelial-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is important for the initiation of allergic airway inflammation through a dendritic cell-mediated T helper 2 response. To identify the factors that control TSLP expression, we examined the ability of inflammatory mediators to regulate TSLP production in human airway epithelial cells. We found that both IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were capable of inducing rapid TSLP production in primary human bronchial airway epithelial cells. We further characterized the human TSLP gene promoter, using two human epithelial cell lines, 16HBEo(-) and A549, and showed that IL-1beta- and TNF-alpha-mediated human TSLP promoter activation in these cells was mediated by an upstream NFkappaB site. Mutation of this NFkappaB site abolished activation, as did overexpression of a dominant-negative version of IkappaB kinase (IKK)beta (a kinase acting on IkappaB, the inhibitor of NFkappaB). Interestingly, human TSLP mRNA levels were also increased after exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR8, and TLR9 ligands, further supporting an important role for NFkappaB in TSLP gene regulation. Similarly, analysis of the mouse TSLP gene promoter revealed the presence of a similarly situated NFkappaB site that was also critical for IL-1beta-inducible expression of mouse TSLP. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the inflammatory mediators IL-1beta and TNF-alpha regulate human TSLP gene expression in an NFkappaB-dependent manner.;Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that have the ability to sense infection and tissue stress, sample and present antigen to T lymphocytes, and induce different forms of immunity and tolerance. The functional versatility of DCs depends on their remarkable ability to translate collectively the information from both the invading microbes and their resident tissue microenvironments and then make an appropriate immune response. Recent progress in understanding TLR biology has illuminated the mechanisms by which DCs link innate and adaptive antimicrobial immune responses. However, how tissue microenvironments shape the function of DCs has remained elusive. Recent studies of TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that strongly activates DCs, provide evidence at a molecular level that epithelial cells/tissue microenvironments directly communicate with DCs. We review recent progress on how TSLP expressed within thymus and peripheral lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues regulates DC-mediated central tolerance, peripheral T cell homeostasis, and inflammatory Th2 responses.;Hematopoiesis originated by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is distinguishable between fetal and adult mice. However, it is not clear whether the altered mode of differentiation is due to the change of properties of HSCs or different microenvironments in fetuses and adults. Here we show that fetal HSCs are fully capable of giving rise to all classes of B cells in the adult microenvironment. HSCs that are derived from fetal liver but not adult bone marrow (BM) of IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha)-deficient mice can also differentiate into B cells, suggesting that both IL-7 and thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP) are dispensable for fetal B cell development, because IL-7Ralpha is commonly used as a subunit of functional receptor complexes for IL-7 and TSLP. Similar IL-7/TSLP independent B cell potential is maintained by BM HSCs until 1 week after birth. In contrast, BM HSCs in mice older than 2 weeks of age absolutely requires IL-7Ralpha for B lymphopoiesis. These results demonstrate that fetal HSCs acquired adult characteristics between 1 and 2 weeks after birth in mouse BM.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin (IL)-7-like cytokine that has recently been implicated as central to the microenvironment and is permissive for the immunologic cascade that initiates and propagates allergic immune responses. In humans, TSLP is produced predominantly by epithelial cells and activated mast cells, and stimulates myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), which uniquely express the heterodimeric TSLP receptor. TSLP-activated mDC can promote naïve CD4+ T cells to differentiate into a Th2 phenotype and can promote the expansion of CD4+ Th2 memory cells. Recent evidence implicates TSLP as playing a pivotal role in the pathobiology of allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis. The potential for TSLP to provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of allergic disorders is compelling, and elucidating the mechanisms that regulate TSLP expression and the effects of TSLP on orchestrating the immune response toward a Th2 phenotype should facilitate this quest.;We have demonstrated that cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), whose expression is rapidly induced upon keratinocyte-selective ablation of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) -alpha and -beta in the mouse (RXRalphabeta(ep-/-) mice), plays a key role in initiating a skin and systemic atopic dermatitis-like phenotype. We show here that topical application of the physiologically active ligand [1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3); calcitriol] of the vitamin D receptor, or of its low-calcemic analog MC903 (calcipotriol; Dovonex), induces TSLP expression in epidermal keratinocytes, which results in an atopic dermatitis-like syndrome mimicking that seen in RXRalphabeta(ep-/-) mutants and transgenic mice overexpressing TSLP in keratinocytes. Furthermore, topical application of retinoic acid receptor RARgamma-selective agonist BMS961 also induces TSLP expression either on its own or synergistically with 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Our data demonstrate that RXR/vitamin D receptor and RXR/retinoic acid receptor-gamma heterodimers and their ligands cell-autonomously control the expression of TSLP in epidermal keratinocytes of the mouse. We propose molecular mechanisms through which vitamin D3 and retinoic acid signalings could be involved in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases.;Allergic disease has currently reached epidemic proportions, with a high percentage of individuals in the developed world exhibiting an allergic response after exposure to some common environmental factors. Although new strategies for the treatment and management of allergic diseases have decreased the mortality rate, a high percentage of affected persons still require frequent hospitalization and experience decreased quality of life.\nAn internet-based literature search was performed for recent contributions on the underlying mechanisms provoking an allergic response and their potential for therapeutic approaches.\nNovel concepts on allergic responses have emerged: allergic disease may result from an imbalance between allergen activation of regulatory T cells and effector T helper 2 cells (Th2), a process in which dendritic cells are key players. Cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-21, IL-25, and human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) seem to be important contributors in allergic processes. New data on IgE effector responses and on the IgE-independent mechanisms involved in allergic reactions have resolved some unanswered questions about these reactions.\nThese new findings on allergic diseases have important implications for diagnosis and management, with potential improvements in prevention and treatment, which could provide a cure in the future.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin, a four helix-bundle cytokine, is expressed mainly by barrier epithelial cells and is a potent activator of several cell types, particularly myeloid dendritic cells. TSLP influences the outcome of interactions between dendritic cells and CD4+ thymocytes and T cells in many situations, such as the regulation of the positive selection of regulatory T cells, maintenance of peripheral CD4+ T cell homeostasis and induction of CD4+ T cell-mediated allergic inflammation.;The identity of TH2 memory cells and the mechanism regulating their maintenance during allergic inflammation remain elusive. We report that circulated human CD4+ T cells expressing the prostaglandin D2 receptor (CRTH2) are TH2 central memory T cells, characterized by their phenotype, TH2 cytokine production, gene-expression profile, and the ability to respond to allergens. Only dendritic cells (DCs) activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) can induce a robust expansion of CRTH2+CD4+ TH2 memory cells, while maintaining their central memory phenotype and TH2 commitments. CRTH2+CD4+ TH2 memory cells activated by TSLP-DCs undergo further TH2 polarization and express cystatin A, Charcot-Leydon crystal protein, and prostaglandin D2 synthase, implying their broader roles in allergic inflammation. Infiltrated CRTH2+CD4+ TH2 effector memory T cells in skin lesion of atopic dermatitis were associated with activated DCs, suggesting that TSLP-DCs play important roles not only in TH2 priming, but also in the maintenance and further polarization of TH2 central memory cells in allergic diseases.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin conditions dendritic cells to support homeostatic proliferation of central memory T cells. In this issue of Immunity, Wang et al. (2006) show that these dendritic cells are critical in maintaining T helper 2 central memory cells and impart them with expression of unique proallergic molecules.;Generation of functional (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in the murine thymus depends on FoxP3. Removal of the thymus from neonatal mice has been shown to result in a multiple organ autoimmune disease phenotype that can be prevented by introducing the FoxP3+ Treg population to the animal. It has therefore, been proposed that functional FoxP3+ Treg cells are not made in the neonatal thymus; however, it remains unclear when and where functional (FoxP3+)(CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+ thymocytes are generated in postnatal thymus.\nWe report that neither FoxP3 mRNA nor protein is expressed in (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+, or (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25- thymocytes until 3-4 days post birth, despite the presence of mature (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+/- thymocytes in the thymus by 1-2 days after birth. (FoxP3-)(CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+ thymocytes from day 2 newborn mice show no Treg activity. Interestingly, we are able to detect low numbers of FoxP3+ thymocytes dispersed throughout the medullary region of the thymus as early as 3-4 days post birth. Expression of FoxP3 is induced in embryonic day 17 fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) after 4-6 days of in vitro culture. Treatment of FTOCs with thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin (TSLP) enhanced expression of FoxP3, and blocking the TSLP receptor reduces FoxP3 expression in FTOC. Furthermore, TSLP stimulates FoxP3 expression in purified (CD4+)CD8- thymocytes, but not in (CD4+)CD8+, (CD4-)CD8+ and (CD4-)CD8- thymocytes.\nExpression of FoxP3 or Treg maturation is ontogenically distinct and kinetically delayed from the generation of (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+ or (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25- thymocytes in the postnatal thymus. TSLP produced from medullary thymic epithelia cells (mTEC) contributes to the expression of FoxP3 and the maturation of natural regulatory T cells. Overall, these results suggest that the development of Treg cells requires paracrine signaling during late stages of thymocyte maturation that is distinct from signaling during positive or negative selection.;Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for several aspects of the development and function of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are critical for maintaining peripheral tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. In cultures from human thymus, dendritic cells (DCs) conditioned with thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) mediate the production of Tregs from CD4(+) CD25(-) thymocytes. In cultures from mouse lymphoid organs, CD86-rich DCs induce the proliferation and improved suppressive function of antigen-specific Tregs. DC-expanded, antigen-specific Tregs show greatly enhanced efficacy relative to polyclonal populations in blocking experimental autoimmunity. In several animal models including NOD diabetes, Tregs directed to one autoantigen are able to block autoimmunity induced by multiple antigens from the target organ. Distinct states of DC differentiation or maturation are likely to be important for the emerging roles of DCs in the biology of Tregs, particularly the control of autoimmunity in an antigen-dependent manner.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin (IL) 7-like cytokine that triggers dendritic cell-mediated T helper (Th)2 inflammatory responses. TSLP is highly expressed by keratinocytes in skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis and is associated with dendritic cell activation in situ, suggesting that TSLP might be a master switch for allergic inflammation at the epithelial cell-dendritic cell interface. New reports now establish a direct link between TSLP expression and the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and asthma in vivo, and begin to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying TSLP-induced allergic inflammation.;Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in the sensitisation process. Upon encounter with an allergen, DCs require interactions with other cells and factors for triggering a primary or secondary immune response. Epithelial cells (ECs) express features of accessory cells, such as expression of HLA-DR, co-stimulatory molecules, functional FcgammaR, molecules of the antigen-processing machinery, and display an ability to internalise antigen. These features may authorize them to function as immunomodulators (e.g. amplification of memory T cells during secondary immune responses). ECs may increase chemokine (e.g. CCL20) secretion thereby attracting DCs. Epithelial human TSLP activates DC, which allow them to prime naive T cells for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while down-regulating IFN-gamma and IL-10. ECs may also influence the local polarization of types l and 2 antigen-presenting cells via PGE(2) by impairing the ability of maturing DC to produce bioactive IL-12 p70. PGE(2) is synergistic with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the induction of functional and phenotypic maturation of DC and induce IL12 p40 production. Sensitisation via the respiratory route may be Th(2) skewed, possibly because the antigen recognition by DC occurs in an environment rich of airway EC-product such as PGE(2).;We recently showed that dendritic cells (DCs) activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) prime naive CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into T helper type 2 (Th2) cells that produced high amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but no interleukin (IL)-10. Here we report that TSLP induced human DCs to express OX40 ligand (OX40L) but not IL-12. TSLP-induced OX40L on DCs was required for triggering naive CD4(+) T cells to produce IL-4, -5, and -13. We further revealed the following three novel functional properties of OX40L: (a) OX40L selectively promoted TNF-alpha, but inhibited IL-10 production in developing Th2 cells; (b) OX40L lost the ability to polarize Th2 cells in the presence of IL-12; and (c) OX40L exacerbated IL-12-induced Th1 cell inflammation by promoting TNF-alpha, while inhibiting IL-10. We conclude that OX40L on TSLP-activated DCs triggers Th2 cell polarization in the absence of IL-12, and propose that OX40L can switch IL-10-producing regulatory Th cell responses into TNF-alpha-producing inflammatory Th cell responses.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that promotes CD4+ T cell homeostasis. We now demonstrate that TSLP is required to mount a normal CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammatory response. TSLP acts directly on naive, but not, memory CD4+ T cells, and promotes their proliferation in response to antigen. In addition, TSLP exerts an effect indirectly through DCs to promote Th2 differentiation of CD4+ T cells. Correspondingly, TSLP receptor (TSLPR) knockout (KO) mice exhibit strong Th1 responses, with high levels of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon-gamma, and immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a, but low production of IL-4, -5, -10, -13, and IgE; moreover, CD4+ T cells from these animals proliferate less well in response to antigen. Furthermore, TSLPR KO mice fail to develop an inflammatory lung response to inhaled antigen unless supplemented with wild-type CD4+ T cells. This underscores an important role for this cytokine in the development of inflammatory and/or allergic responses in vivo.;The cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been linked to human allergic inflammatory diseases. We show here that TSLP expression was increased in the lungs of mice with antigen-induced asthma, whereas TSLP receptor-deficient mice had considerably attenuated disease. Lung-specific expression of a Tslp transgene induced airway inflammation and hyperreactivity characterized by T helper type 2 cytokines and increased immunoglobulin E. The lungs of Tslp-transgenic mice showed massive infiltration of leukocytes, goblet cell hyperplasia and subepithelial fibrosis. TSLP was capable of activating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to upregulate costimulatory molecules and produce the T helper type 2 cell-attracting chemokine CCL17. These findings suggest that TSLP is an important factor necessary and sufficient for the initiation of allergic airway inflammation.;16121185'};The cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) and other allergic diseases in humans. To further characterize its role in this disease process, transgenic mice were generated that express a keratinocyte-specific, tetracycline-inducible TSLP transgene. Skin-specific overexpression of TSLP resulted in an AD-like phenotype, with the development of eczematous lesions containing inflammatory dermal cellular infiltrates, a dramatic increase in Th2 CD4+ T cells expressing cutaneous homing receptors, and elevated serum levels of IgE. These transgenic mice demonstrate that TSLP can initiate a cascade of allergic inflammation in the skin and provide a valuable animal model for future study of this common disease.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is said to increase expression of chemokines attracting Th2 T cells. We hypothesized that asthma is characterized by elevated bronchial mucosal expression of TSLP and Th2-attracting, but not Th1-attracting, chemokines as compared with controls, with selective accumulation of cells bearing receptors for these chemokines. We used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to examine the expression and cellular provenance of TSLP, Th2-attracting (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)/CCL17, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)/CCL22, I-309/CCL1) and Th1-attracting (IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10)/CXCL10, IFN-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant (I-TAC)/CXCL11) chemokines and expression of their receptors CCR4, CCR8, and CXCR3 in bronchial biopsies from 20 asthmatics and 15 normal controls. The numbers of cells within the bronchial epithelium and submucosa expressing mRNA for TSLP, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22, and IP-10/CXCL10, but not I-TAC/CXCL11 and I-309/CCL1, were significantly increased in asthmatics as compared with controls (p </= 0.018). TSLP and TARC/CCL17 expression correlated with airway obstruction. Although the total numbers of cells expressing CCR4, CCR8, and CXCR3 did not significantly differ in the asthmatics and controls, there was evidence of selective infiltration of CD4(+)/CCR4(+) T cells in the asthmatic biopsies which correlated with TARC and MDC expression and airway obstruction. Epithelial cells, endothelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells were significant sources of TSLP and chemokines. Our data implicate TSLP, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22, and IP-10/CXCL10 in asthma pathogenesis. These may act partly through selective development and retention, or recruitment of Th2 cells bearing their receptors.;To construct and express recombinant adenovirus bearing human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene.\nTSLP gene amplified from human fetal lung cells was first cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1, and then subcloned into shuttle vector pShuttle. The resultant plasmid was subsequently cotransformed into E. coli BJ5183 cells with adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. The recombinant adenovirus plasmid containing TSLP was digested with Pac I and transfected into HEK293 cells to package recombinant adenovirus particles. The TSLP gene of the recombinant virus was detected by PCR, and its expression was analyzed by Western blot.\nRecombinant adenovirus vector bearing human TSLP gene was constructed by homologous recombination in E.coli, and recombinant adenovirus was obtained by transfecting HEK293 cells with this infectious DNA. PCR test indicated that TSLP gene was successfully integrated into the adenoviral genome, and the titer of the recombinant Ad reached 1 x 10(11) pfu/L. Meanwhile, expression of TSLP in the infected Hela cells was confirmed by Western blot.\nThe construction of recombinant adenovirus bearing human TSLP gene and its expression mediated by this adenovirus pave a foundation for the study on the biological function of this novel cytokine.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was reported to induce dendritic cells to produce Th2-attracting chemokines, followed by allergic inflammation through stimulating not only CD4-positive T cells but also CD8-positive T cells. Therefore, in this experiment, GeneChip and hierarchical clustering were applied to screen the molecules in whole immunity triggered by TSLP directly and indirectly using both adult peripheral and cord blood mononuclear cells as well as isolated monocytes. Gene expression profiles screened a variety of molecules that are triggered by TSLP with or without CD40 ligation. In the profile, RNA expressions of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, that is known to induce anergy of T cells and natural killer cells in protecting fetal rejection; many kinds of proteasomes that were reported to trigger cytokine production by inhibiting suppressors of NF-kappaB; and several kinds of chemokines increased, whereas RNA expression of superoxide dismutase 1 decreased, which was unexpected but considered worthy of notice. Expression of chemokines at protein levels and enzymatic activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was further confirmed to increase in the presence of TSLP using ELISA and HPLC, respectively. These results suggest that the advent of microarray technology may enable us to screen novel molecular targets to treat TSLP-related allergic inflammation.;Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a major T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine, primes dendritic cells (DCs) for IL-12 production, suggesting a negative feedback loop to prevent dysregulated Th2 inflammation, such as allergy. We previously showed that human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), highly expressed by keratinocytes of atopic dermatitis, activates CD11c(+) DCs to induce the differentiation of naive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells into proallergic effectors. Here we show that TSLP primes DCs to produce large amounts of IL-12 after CD40 ligand stimulation, similar to IL-4 priming of DCs. In contrast to IL-4 priming, DCs activated with TSLP and CD40 ligand induce the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into effectors producing both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, a unique profile that is reminiscent of the late phase of allergy. Thus, TSLP is a major regulatory cytokine for IL-12 production by DCs, and TSLP-activated DCs could promote the persistence of Th2 inflammation even in the presence of IL-12-inducing signals.;Analysis of gene-targeted mice and patients with severe combined immunodeficiency due to mutations of the alpha chain of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7Ralpha) has shown important differences between mice and humans in the role played by IL-7 in lymphoid development. More recently, it has been shown that IL-7Ralpha is also shared by the receptor for another cytokine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). In this review, we discuss recent advances in IL-7- and TSLP-mediated;signaling. We also report on the clinical and immunological features of 16 novel patients with IL-7Ralpha deficiency and discuss the results of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.;IL-7 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are two major cytokines controlling murine B cell development. IL-7 has been studied extensively, but only recently has it become possible to unravel the role of TSLP in detail. We studied the biological activities of TSLP in B cell development at distinct ages in the mouse. On the one hand, TSLP is able to give rise to a measurable B1 cell compartment derived from fetal liver pro-B cells, although, as is the case for B2 cells, it does not play a prevalent role in the development of this subset. On the other hand, TSLP drives the proliferation of pro-B cells from the fetal and neonatal liver, but in the bone marrow environment, B cell precursors require pre-B cell receptor expression for TSLP responsiveness.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) signals via a receptor comprising the interleukin (IL)-7 receptor alpha chain and a distinctive subunit, TSLP receptor (TSLPR), which is most related to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain, gamma(c). We have generated TSLPR knockout (KO) mice and found that although these mice had normal lymphocyte numbers, gamma(c)/TSLPR double KO mice had a greater lymphoid defect than gamma(c) KO mice. This indicates that TSLP contributes to lymphoid development and accounts for some of the residual lymphoid development in gamma(c) KO mice and presumably in patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. Injection of TSLP into gamma(c) KO mice induced the expansion of T and B cells. Moreover, sublethally irradiated TSLPR KO mice showed weaker recovery of lymphocyte populations than wild-type (WT) littermates, even when neutralizing anti-IL-7 antibodies were injected. Interestingly, TSLP preferentially stimulated the proliferation and survival of CD4(+) single positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells in vitro. Additionally, CD4(+) T cells from TSLPR KO mice expanded less efficiently than WT CD4(+) T cells in irradiated hosts, and TSLP preferentially expanded CD4(+) T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, as compared with other known cytokines, TSLP is distinctive in exhibiting a lineage preference for the expansion and survival of CD4(+) T cells.;A sterically stabilized immunolipoplex (TsPLP), containing an antitransferrin receptor single-chain antibody fragment (TfRscFv)-PEG molecule, has been developed to specifically and efficiently deliver a therapeutic gene to tumor cells. A postcoating preparation strategy was employed in which a DNA/lipid complex (lipoplex) was formed first and then sequentially conjugated with PEG and TfRscFv. The complex prepared by this method was shown to be superior in ability to deliver genes to tumor cells than when prepared by a common precoating strategy, in which DNA is mixed with TfRscFv-PEG conjugated liposome. Using prostate cancer cell line DU145, a comparison was made between the in vitro and in vivo gene delivery efficiencies of four complexes, Lipoplex (LP), PEG-Lipoplex (PLP), TfRscFv-PEG-Lipoplex (TsPLP) and our standard TfRscFv-Lipoplex (TsLP). In vitro, the order of transfection efficiency was TsLP>LP approximately TsPLP>PLP. However, in vivo the order of transfection efficiency, after systemic administration via the tail vein, was TsPLP>TsLP>LP or PLP with TsPLP-mediated exogenous gene expression in tumor being two-fold higher than when mediated by TsLP. This suggests that the in vitro transfection efficiency of TsPLP was not indicative of its in vivo efficiency. In addition, it was found that the level of exogenous gene expression in the tumor mediated by TsPLP was higher than that mediated by TsLP and did not decrease over the time. More importantly, high exogenous gene expression in tumor, but low expression in liver, was observed after an i.v. delivery of TsPLP carrying either the GFP reporter gene or the p53 gene, indicating that tumor preferential targeting was  maintained by this complex in the presence of PEG. These findings show that incorporation of PEG into our targeted lipoplex results in a more efficient delivery of the complex to the tumor cells, possibly by inhibiting the first pass clearance observed with non-PEG containing liposomes. Therefore, these data demonstrate that TsPLP is a improvement over our previously established tumor targeted gene delivery complex for systemic gene therapy of cancer.;Mice overexpressing thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) develop mixed cryoglobulinemia with renal disease closely resembling human cryoglobulin-associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), including glomerular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement. We assessed the effect of complement inhibition through overexpression of Crry (complement receptor-1 related gene/protein Y), which blocks the classic and alternative pathway of complement activation through inhibition of the C3 convertase, in cryoglobulinemia-associated immune complex glomerulonephritis.\nTSLP transgenic mice were crossbred with animals overexpressing Crry. Mice were sacrificed after 50 days (females) or 120 days (males), and kidneys, blood, and urine were collected from seven mice of each experimental group (wild type, Crry transgenic, TSLP transgenic, and Crry/TSLP doubly transgenic).\nTSLP/Crry doubly transgenic animals demonstrated expected serum levels of Crry. Renal involvement, both in TSLP transgenic and TSLP/Crry doubly transgenic animals, was characterized by glomerular matrix expansion, macrophage influx, activation of mesangial cells, and deposition of immunoglobulins and complement. Overexpression of Crry did not result in significant improvement of renal pathology or laboratory findings. Expression of recombinant soluble Crry was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in Crry transgenic animals. However, formation of the membrane attack complex C5b-9 as a marker of terminal active complement components and represented by glomerular C9 staining could not be inhibited in Crry transgenic TSLP mice.\nThese results indicate that overexpression of Crry was not sufficient to prevent renal injury in TSLP transgenic mice. We suggest that the inhibitory capacity of Crry may be overwhelmed by chronic complement activation. Further studies need to address the role of complement in cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis before therapeutic complement inhibition can be attempted.;Major portal pressure increase occurs on the second day post-stenosing-ligation of the portal vein in the rat and it is associated with pancreatic edema, intraperitoneal free exudate, hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia. All this suggests the development of a regional exudative inflammatory response. In order to verify this hypothesis the steroid budesonide, whose antiinflammatory activity could prevent these alterations, was administered to rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. Wistar male rats were divided into the following groups: Control rats that were administered saline solution (CS; n = 10), Control rats that were administered budesonide (36 mg/kg per day; CB; n = 10), triple stenosing ligation of portal vein (TSLP) with saline solution (n = 10) and triple stenosing ligation of portal vein with budesonide (36 mg/kg per day; n = 10). In rats with prehepatic portal hypertension at 48 h of postoperative evolution, budesonide decreases the incidence of pancreatic edema, of peritoneal free exudate, of mesenteric adenopathies and prevents hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia and hyper-beta-globulinemia. Some of the macroscopic intra-abdominal alterations and some of the changes in the electrophoretic pattern found in portal hypertensive rats could have an inflammatory etiopathogeny because budesonide shows an effective prophylaxis.;Five core cytokines that control lymphocyte differentiation and maintenance have been identified and studied in depth. IL-7 sits at the apex of this cytokine hierarchy in terms of functional significance during lymphocyte development. The IL-7-dominant phase of lymphopoiesis is preceded by the actions of c-Kit ligand (also called stem cell factor; SCF) and fetal liver kinase 2 ligand (Flk-2L); the function of both of these cytokines is essential for the maintenance and development of the progenitor compartment of multiple lineages. IL-7 activity is complemented by two cytokines whose receptors share components of the IL-7 receptor: thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IL-15. The influences of these core cytokines on precursor lymphocyte subsets overlap during development and are often synergistic. Recent studies are beginning to uncover the molecular mechanisms of these interrelated core cytokine functions.;Allergy is the result of a complex immune cascade leading to the dysregulated production of Th2 cytokines, the generation of allergen-specific IgE-producing B cells and the subsequent activation and degranulation of mast cells upon allergen challenge. Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in several models of allergy, but factors instructing DCs to induce a dysregulated Th2 response are currently unknown. In this review, we present recent evidence that human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a novel IL-7-like cytokine, might represent an early trigger of the allergic immune cascade. TSLP-activated human DCs produce Th2-attracting chemokines but no IL-12, and induce naive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell differentiation into effector cells with a typical pro-allergic phenotype. TSLP is produced by human epithelial, stromal, and mast cells. It is highly expressed by the keratinocytes of atopic dermatitis but not in other types of skin inflammation. Thus, epithelial- and stromal-cell-derived TSLP might represent one of the factors initiating the allergic responses, and could be a target for a curative therapeutic approach to allergy.;The murine cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) supports the development of B220+ IgM+ immature B cells and induces thymocyte proliferation in vitro. Human TSLP, by contrast, activates CD11c+ dendritic cells, but not B or T cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that the receptor for TSLP consists of a heterodimer of the interleukin 7 (IL-7) alpha chain and a novel protein that resembles the hematopoietic cytokine receptor common gamma chain. We examined signal transduction by the gamma-like chains using chimeric receptor proteins. The cytoplasmic domain of the human, but not of the murine, gamma-like chain, activates Jak2 and Stat5 and supports the proliferation of hematopoietic cell lines. In order to assess the role of the murine gamma-like chain in vivo, we generated gamma-like chain-deficient mice. Receptor-deficient mice are unresponsive to TSLP but exhibit no obvious phenotypic defects. In particular, hematopoietic cell development appeared normal. B-cell development, including the IgM+ compartment, was unaffected by loss of the TSLP pathway, as were T lymphopoiesis and lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. Cytokine receptors that utilize the common gamma chain signal through the lymphocyte-specific kinase Jak3. Mice deficient in Jak3 exhibit a SCID phenotype but harbor a residual B220+ splenic lymphocyte population. We demonstrate here that this residual lymphocyte population is lost in mice lacking both the gamma-like chain and Jak3.;T cell homeostasis is a self-regulating process for maintaining the size of the peripheral T cell pool. Although dendritic cells (DCs) seem to be important in T cell homeostasis, the molecular regulation of DC-mediated T cell homeostasis is unknown. We show that human DCs activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) induced a robust expansion of autologous CD4(+) T cell populations, which depended on self peptide-major histocompatibility complex. The proliferating T cells adopted and maintained a central memory polyclonal phenotype and could differentiate into T helper type 1 or type 2 effector cells. These results, together with findings of TSLP expression in epithelial cells of mucosal lymphoid tissues and thymus, indicate that TSLP is involved in DC-mediated CD4(+) T cell homeostasis.;The role of thymic stromal cell-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP) in regulating hematopoiesis is poorly characterized, so we investigated its regulatory effects in vivo using TSLP transgenic mice. Overexpression of TSLP disrupted hematopoietic homeostasis by causing imbalances in lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis. Mice harboring a TSLP transgene had 5- to 700-fold fewer B and T precursors and no detectable pre-B lymphocyte colonyforming activity in the marrow or spleen. Conversely, TSLP transgenic mice possessed 15 to 20 times more splenic myeloid precursors than their littermates, and progenitor activity of the granulocyteerythrocyte-macrophage-megakaryocyte colony-forming units was significantly elevated. The arrest in lymphopoiesis and the expansion of myeloid progenitor cells in TSLP transgenic mice suggest that TSLP has negative and positive regulatory effects on lymphoid and myeloid development, respectively.;Engagement of immunoglobulin-binding receptors (FcgammaR) on leukocytes and other cell types is one means by which immunoglobulins and immune complexes activate effector cells. One of these FcgammaRs, FcgammaRIIb, is thought to contribute to protection from autoimmune disease by down-regulation of B-cell responsiveness and myeloid cell activation. We assessed the role of FcgammaRIIb in a mouse model of cryoglobulin-associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis induced by overexpression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP transgenic mice were crossbred with animals deficient for FcgammaRIIb on the same genetic background (C57BL/6). Renal pathology was assessed in female and male animals (wild-type, FcgammaRIIb-/-, TSLP transgenic, and combined TSLP transgenic/FcgammaRIIb-/- mice) after 50 and 120 days, respectively. FcgammaRIIb-/- mice had no significant renal pathology, whereas overexpression of TSLP induced a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, as previously established. TSLP transgenic FcgammaRIIb-/- mice appeared sick with increased mortality. Kidney function was significantly impaired in male mice corresponding to aggravated glomerular pathology with increases in glomerular matrix and cellularity. This resulted from both a large influx of infiltrating macrophages and increased cellular proliferation. These results emphasize the important role of FcgammaRIIb in regulating immune responses and suggest that modulation of Fcgamma receptor activation or expression may be a useful therapeutic approach for treating glomerular diseases.;Deletions of interleukin 7 (IL-7) or its receptor components permit fetal but not adult B cell development in mice. Mice deficient in IL-7 receptor alpha (IL-7R alpha) had 1% the number of B cells of controls and 10% that of mice deficient in the common gamma chain. As IL-7R alpha is also a receptor for thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP), we assayed the ability of TSLP to support proliferation of fetal or adult precursor B cells. Only fetal-derived pro-B cells were able to respond to TSLP, although pre-B cells from both origins were TSLP-responsive. Fetal but not adult precursors generated a measurable B cell compartment in the absence of IL-7. The residual B cells found in IL-7R alpha-deficient mice required fetal liver kinase 2 (Flk-2) for their development. Thus, IL-7R alpha- and Flk-2-mediated signals account for the generation of almost all mouse B lymphocytes.;Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a novel epithelial cell-derived cytokine, which induces dendritic cell (DC)-mediated CD4+ T cell responses with a proallergic phenotype. Although the participation of CD8+ T cells in allergic inflammation is well documented, their functional properties as well as the pathways leading to their generation remain poorly understood. Here, we show that TSLP-activated CD11c+ DCs potently activate and expand naive CD8+ T cells, and induce their differentiation into interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13-producing effectors exhibiting poor cytolytic activity. Additional CD40L triggering of TSLP-activated DCs induced CD8+ T cells with potent cytolytic activity, producing large amounts of interferon (IFN)-gamma, while retaining their capacity to produce IL-5 and IL-13. These data further support the role of TSLP as initial trigger of allergic T cell responses and suggest that CD40L-expressing cells may act in combination with TSLP to amplify and sustain pro-allergic responses and cause tissue damage by promoting the generation of IFN-gamma-producing cytotoxic effectors.;Increased expression of growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are thought to play pivotal roles during mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) transgenic mice develop mixed cryoglobulinemia and a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Here we describe the renal expression of isoforms of PDGF and TGF-beta in relation to changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) components and markers of cell proliferation and activation in this model.\nA total of 123 mice, including 61 TSLP transgenic mice and 62 wild-type controls, were sacrificed at defined intervals. PDGF-A chain, -B chain, PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor (beta-R) and TGF-beta1 mRNA were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA), collagen type I, collagen type IV, laminin, and a marker of proliferating cells (PCNA) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Slides also were studied by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization with an antibody that recognizes monocytes/macrophage and with riboprobes that detect PDGF B-chain, PDGF beta-R or TGF-beta1 mRNA.\nIncreased numbers of proliferating glomerular cells appeared early in the disease course, associated with de novo expression of alphaSMA. Expression of PDGF B-chain and beta-R mRNA was increased in the mesangium and in parietal epithelial cells of TSLP transgenic mice and correlated with the number of PCNA positive cells. Increased TGF-beta1 mRNA expression paralleled the deposition of type IV collagen. A significant proportion of Mac-2 positive macrophages expressed TGF-beta1 mRNA, while only a small percentage of glomerular macrophages expressed PDGF B-chain mRNA. No PDGF beta-R mRNA expression by macrophages was detected.\nTSLP transgenic mice develop a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in which glomerular cell proliferation and matrix deposition are associated with an increased expression of PDGF B-chain, PDGF beta-R and TGF-beta1. These findings extend the paradigms covering these growth factors established in the rat Thy 1 model of mesangiolysis and repairs to a murine model of progressive glomerulonephritis closely resembling human MPGN.;Here we demonstrate that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and FGFR2IIIb signaling can affect development and function of thymic epithelium (TE) and that alphabeta-lineage thymocytes contribute to intrathymic levels of KGF. Thymocyte expression of KGF is developmentally regulated, being undetectable in CD3-4-8- thymocytes and expressed at highest levels by mature CD4 or CD8 thymocytes. Exposure of thymocyte-depleted fetal thymic lobes to KGF resulted in reduced thymic epithelial expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), invariant chain (Ii), and cathepsin L (CatL) molecules involved in thymocyte-positive selection and also stimulated expression of the cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP), while having little effect on IL-7 or stem cell factor expression. Within intact fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC), exogenous KGF impairs the generation of CD4 thymocytes. Two lines of evidence point to responsiveness of the medullary TE compartment to KGF and FGFR2IIIb signaling. First, the medullary compartment is expanded in intact FTOC exposed to KGF in vitro. Second, in the RAG-deficient thymus, where the thymocytes do not express detectable levels of KGF message, the hypoplastic medullary TE compartment can be expanded by administration of recombinant KGF in vivo. This expansion is accompanied by restoration of the normal profile of medullary TE-associated chemokine expression in the RAG2(-/-) thymus. Collectively, these findings point to a role for KGF and FGFR signaling in the development and function of thymic epithelium.;Interleukin (IL)-2 is a type I four-alpha-helical bundle cytokine that plays vital roles in antigen-mediated proliferation of peripheral blood T cells and also is critical for activation-induced cell death. We now demonstrate that IL-2 potently decreases expression of IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha) mRNA and protein. The fact that IL-7Ralpha is a component of the receptors for both IL-7 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suggests that IL-2 can negatively regulate signals by each of these cytokines. Previously it was known that the IL-2 and IL-7 receptors shared the common cytokine receptor gamma chain, gamma(c), which suggested a possible competition between these cytokines for a receptor component. Our findings now suggest a previously unknown type of cross-talk between IL-2 and IL-7 signaling by showing that IL-2 signaling can diminish IL-7Ralpha expression via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent mechanism.;12087416'};Whether epithelial cells play a role in triggering the immune cascade leading to T helper 2 (T(H)2)-type allergic inflammation is not known. We show here that human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) potently activated CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and induced production of the T(H)2-attracting chemokines TARC (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine; also known as CCL17) and MDC (macrophage-derived chemokine; CCL22). TSLP-activated DCs primed naïve T(H) cells to produce the proallergic cytokines interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while down-regulating IL-10 and interferon-gamma. TSLP was highly expressed by epithelial cells, especially keratinocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis. TSLP expression was associated with Langerhans cell migration and activation in situ. These findings shed new light on the function of human TSLP and the role played by epithelial cells and DCs in initiating allergic inflammation.;Cryoglobulins are associated with the development of a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, often referred to as cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis, particularly in the setting of hepatitis C virus infection. Parenteral interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) commonly is used therapeutically in humans with cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. We tested the therapeutic impact of oral IFN-alpha treatment in thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) transgenic mice, a strain that develops mixed cryoglobulinemia with glomerulonephritis closely resembling the disease that occurs in humans. A total of 41 female mice were treated for 21 days with daily ingestion of either 500 IU of Universal type I IFN or placebo. The studied groups included TSLP transgenic mice treated with IFN-alpha (n = 13), TSLP transgenic mice treated with placebo (n = 13), wild-type mice treated with IFN-alpha (n = 5), and wild-type mice treated with placebo (n = 10). A total of 39 mice completed the study; two TSLP transgenic mice treated with IFN-alpha died during the study period. Placebo-treated TSLP transgenic mice showed significantly increased mean glomerular tuft areas, mean glomerular areas occupied by macrophages, and mean cell numbers per glomerulus compared with wild-type controls. All three parameters were decreased in IFN-alpha-treated TSLP transgenic mice, although the differences compared with placebo-treated mice did not reach significance. The changes in glomerular matrix deposition were the same in IFN-alpha-treated and placebo-treated mice. The oral ingestion of IFN-alpha seemed to reduce glomerular macrophage influx, but this did not result in decreased glomerular matrix deposition. The limited positive effect provides experimental support for clinical studies that indicate the beneficial effects of IFN-alpha therapy observed in humans with glomerulonephritis might be attributable to its antiviral effect rather than modulation of intrarenal pathophysiologic pathways.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that facilitates B lymphocyte differentiation and costimulates T cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that a functional TSLP receptor complex is a heterodimer consisting of the TSLP receptor and the IL-7R alpha-chain. TSLP-mediated signaling is unique among members of the cytokine receptor family in that activation of the transcription factor Stat5 occurs without detectable Janus kinase activation. Using a variety of biological systems we demonstrate here that TSLP-mediated Stat5 activation can be uncoupled from proliferation. We also show that the single tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the TSLP receptor is critical for TSLP-mediated proliferation, but is dispensable for Stat5 activation. Our data demonstrate that TSLP-mediated Stat5 activation is insufficient for cell proliferation and identifies residues within the TSLP receptor complex required to mediate these downstream events.;Thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) is a novel receptor subunit that is related in sequence to the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor common gamma chain. TSLPR forms a heterodimeric complex with the IL-7 receptor alpha chain to form the receptor for thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin, a cytokine involved in B- and T-cell function. We have cloned the TSLP receptor from rat and find that the WSXWX motif commonly found in extracellular domains of cytokine receptors is conserved as a W(T/S)XV(T/A) motif among TSLP receptors from mouse, rat and human. As in the mouse, TSLP receptor is widely expressed in rats suggesting that TSLPR may have roles in signaling outside the hematopoietic system. A zooblot analysis revealed that TSLPR is expressed in all vertebrate species examined. The absence of TSLPR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes is similar to the expression of several other cytokine receptors that have been characterized thus far. We have also characterized the genomic structure of the murine Tslpr gene which shows that in addition to primary sequence homology, it shares a common genomic organization of coding exons with the murine IL-2 receptor common gamma chain (Il2rg). Use of an alternative splice acceptor site leads to two alternatively spliced transcript variants of murine TSLPR, both of which are functional receptors. Finally, using linkage analysis, we mapped the murine Tslpr gene to mouse chromosome 5 between the Ecm2 and Pxn genes.;Mixed cryoglobulins are complexes of immunoglobulins that reversibly precipitate in the cold and lead to a systemic disease in humans. Renal involvement usually manifests as a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with marked monocyte infiltration and, at times, intracapillary thrombi. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a recently cloned cytokine that supports differentiation and long-term growth of B cells. Here we report that TSLP overexpression in mice results in the development of mixed cryoglobulins, with renal involvement closely resembling cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis as it occurs in humans. One hundred twenty-three mice were sacrificed at monthly intervals, with at least five TSLP transgenic mice and five controls in each group. Blood, kidneys, spleen, liver, lung, and ear were collected and studied by routine microscopy, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. TSLP transgenic animals developed polyclonal mixed cryoglobulinemia (type III) and a systemic inflammatory disease involving the kidney, spleen, liver, lung, and ears. Renal involvement was of a membranoproliferative type demonstrating thickened capillary walls with cellular interposition and double contours of the basement membrane, expansion of the mesangium because of increased matrix and accumulation of immune-deposits, subendothelial immune-deposits, focal occlusion of capillary loops, and monocyte/macrophage influx. In contrast to the severe glomerular lesions, the tubulointerstitium was not involved in the disease process. The renal lesions and the disease course were more severe in females when compared to males. We describe a mouse strain in which a B-cell-promoting cytokine leads to formation of large amounts of mixed cryoglobulins and a systemic inflammatory injury that resembles important aspects of human cryoglobulinemia. This is the first reproducible mouse model of renal involvement in mixed cryoglobulinemia, which enables detailed studies of a membranoproliferative pattern of glomerular injury.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a novel cytokine that was found to promote the development of murine B cells in vitro. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the human homologue of murine TSLP. This protein, which is expressed in a number of tissues including heart, liver and prostate, prevented apoptosis and stimulated growth of the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived cell line MUTZ-3. Anti-interleukin (IL)-7 receptor antibodies (Abs) neutralized this effect indicating that TSLP binds to at least part of the IL-7 receptor complex. TSLP induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-5. In contrast to IL-7, TSLP-triggered STAT-5 phosphorylation was not preceded by activation of janus kinase (JAK) 3. These findings would be in accordance with the notion, raised previously for the mouse system, that TSLP leads to STAT-5 phosphorylation by activating other kinases than the JAKs. Some other signaling pathways stimulated by many cytokines are not involved in TSLP activity; thus, TSLP did not stimulate activation of ERK1,2 and p70S6K. Furthermore, neutralizing Abs raised against cytokines known to stimulate the growth of MUTZ-3 cells did not inhibit the proliferative effects of TSLP, suggesting that TSLP-induced growth was a direct effect. In summary, we describe the cloning of human TSLP and its proliferative effects on a myeloid cell line. TSLP-induced proliferation is preceded by phosphorylation of;STAT-5, but not of JAK 3.;In a search for a human sequence related to a recently identified type I cytokine receptor delta1, which turned out to be a receptor subunit for a cytokine called TSLP, we have now identified a novel human type I cytokine receptor from a human T lymphocyte cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of 371 residues has a typical signal sequence and a membrane-spanning region. The mature protein is predicted to have a molecular mass of 39,698 Da. The N-terminal extracellular region contains two fibronectin type III-like domains, four conserved cysteine residues, and a WSXWS box-like motif. The C-terminal intracellular region contains box 1 and box 2-like motifs. Thus, it has common characteristics of type I cytokine receptor family members, and we tentatively termed this protein CRLF2, which stands for cytokine receptor-like factor 2. Northern blot analysis revealed CRLF2 mRNA in liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle. The fetal liver also expresses CRLF2 transcripts. The gene for CRLF2 was mapped to the pseudoautosomal region, Xp22.3 and Yp11.3 by FISH analysis, a region where genes encoding the IL-3 receptor alpha and the GM-CSF receptor alpha chains are also located. The biological function of this newly identified receptor is now under investigation.;The sequence of a novel hemopoietic cytokine was discovered in a computational screen of genomic databases, and its homology to mouse thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suggests that it is the human orthologue. Human TSLP is proposed to signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex that consists of a new member of the hemopoietin family termed human TSLP receptor and the IL-7R alpha-chain. Cells transfected with both receptor subunits proliferated in response to purified, recombinant human TSLP, with induced phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5. Human TSLPR and IL-7Ralpha are principally coexpressed on monocytes and dendritic cell populations and to a much lesser extent on various lymphoid cells. In accord, we find that human TSLP functions mainly on myeloid cells; it induces the release of T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes and, in particular, enhances the maturation of CD11c(+) dendritic cells, as evidenced by the strong induction of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 and the enhanced capacity to elicit proliferation of naive T cells.;Signaling by type I cytokines involves the formation of receptor homodimers, heterodimers or higher order receptor oligomers. Here we report the cloning of a type I cytokine receptor subunit that is most closely related to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma c). Binding and crosslinking experiments demonstrate that this protein is the receptor for a recently described interleukin 7 (IL-7)-like factor, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Binding of TSLP to the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) is increased markedly in the presence of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7R alpha). IL-7R alpha-expressing but not parental 32D cells proliferate in the presence of exogenous TSLP. Moreover, a combination of IL-7R alpha and TSLPR is required for TSLP-dependent activation of a STAT5-dependent reporter construct. Thus it is shown that IL-7R alpha is a component of both the IL-7 and TSLP receptors, which helps to explain why deletion of the gene that;encodes IL-7R alpha affects the lymphoid system more severely than deletion of the gene encoding IL-7 does. Cloning of TSLPR should facilitate an understanding of TSLP function and its signaling mechanism.;Using a bioassay consisting of the proliferation of a murine B cell line, a cDNA of a gene whose product supports the growth of that cell line was isolated from a thymic stromal cell line. This factor, termed thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), is a protein of 140 amino acids. The gene encoding TSLP was mapped to murine chromosome 18. Purified recombinant TSLP supported the growth of pre-B cell colonies in vitro, but had no myelopoietic activity. TSLP had comitogenic activity for fetal thymocytes, but was not as potent as interleukin 7 in lobe submersion cultures. Injection of TSLP into neonatal mice induced the expansion of B220(+)BP-1(+) pre-B cells.;The cellular receptor for murine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was detected in a variety of murine, but not human myelomonocytic cell lines by radioligand binding. cDNA clones encoding the receptor were isolated from a murine T helper cell cDNA library. TSLP receptor (TSLPR) is a member of the hematopoietin receptor family. Transfection of TSLPR cDNA resulted in only low affinity binding. Cotransfection of the interleukin 7 (IL-7)Ralpha chain cDNA resulted in conversion to high affinity binding. TSLP did not activate cells from IL-7Ralpha(-/)- mice, but did activate cells from gammac(-/)- mice. Thus, the functional TSLPR requires the IL-7Ralpha chain, but not the gammac chain for signaling.;Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a newly identified cytokine that uniquely promotes B lymphopoiesis to the B220+/IgM+ immature B cell stage. In addition, TSLP shares many biological properties with the related cytokine IL-7. This can be explained by the finding that the receptor complexes for TSLP and IL-7 both contain the IL-7R alpha-chain; IL-7Ralpha is paired with the common gamma-chain (gammac) in the IL-7 receptor complex and the unique TSLP-R chain in the TSLP receptor complex. Although TSLP and IL-7 both induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor Stat5, only IL-7-mediated signal transduction could be associated with activation of Janus family kinases (Jaks). Because Stat5 phosphorylation following cytokine stimulation is generally mediated by Jaks, the lack of Jak activation after TSLP treatment suggested the possibility that tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5 may be nonfunctional. Herein, we demonstrate that TSLP induces a functional Stat5 transcription factor in that TSLP stimulation results in Stat5-DNA complex formation and transcription of the Stat5-responsive gene CIS. We also show that the TSLP receptor complex is functionally reconstituted using TSLP-R and IL-7Ralpha and that TSLP-mediated signal transduction requires Stat5. Moreover, TSLP-mediated signaling is inhibited by suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1  and a kinase-deficient version of Tec but not by kinase-deficient forms of Jak1 and Jak2.;A novel cytokine from a thymic stromal cell line (thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)) promotes the development of B220+/IgM+ immature B cells when added to fetal liver cultures, long term bone marrow cultures, or bone marrow cells plated in semisolid medium. Because the activities of TSLP overlap with those of IL-7 in some in vitro assays, we compared the signaling mechanisms employed by TSLP and IL-7. Proliferation of a factor-dependent pre-B cell line (NAG8/7) in response to either TSLP or IL-7 was inhibited by anti-IL-7R alpha mAbs, suggesting that the functional TSLP receptor complex uses IL-7R alpha. In contrast, three different Abs to the common cytokine receptor gamma-chain had no effect on the response of these cells to TSLP, indicating that the functional TSLP receptor complex does not use the common cytokine receptor gamma-chain. Both cytokines induced activation of Stat5, but only IL-7 induced activation of the Janus family kinases Jak1 and Jak3. In fact, TSLP failed to activate any of the four known Janus family kinases, suggesting that Stat5 phosphorylation is mediated by a novel mechanism. Taken together, these data support the idea that TSLP can make unique contributions to B lymphopoiesis and indicate that it does so by mechanisms distinct from IL-7.;T-cell receptor (TCR) genes need to be rearranged by a site specific-VDJ recombinase before they are expressed. This process, initiated in CD44+25+ thymocytes, takes place during the early stage of T-cell differentiation in the thymus. Interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain knockout (IL-7R-/-) mice are severely deficient in B-lymphocytes and alpha beta T-cells and completely lack the gamma delta T-cell lineage. Thymocyte development is arrested at a very early stage (DN CD44+CD25-). Because this arrest is earlier than in mice with a block in VDJ recombination, we examined the rearrangement status of TCR genes in thymocytes from IL-7R-/- mice. The TCR beta locus showed a nearly normal pattern of VDJ rearrangements, consistent with the presence of alpha beta T-cells in these mice. However, TCR gamma locus rearrangement was absent or severely reduced for all the V gamma genes analyzed (V gamma 3, V gamma 4, V gamma 1.1, V gamma 1.2 and V gamma 2). In contrast, the delta locus showed little reduction in rearrangement. The defect in gamma rearrangements in IL-7R-/- thymocytes is not simply due to an absence of mature gamma delta T-cells, since TCR delta-/- mice, which also have only alpha beta T-cells, had normal levels of gamma and delta rearrangements. These findings indicate that one or both of the two known ligands of IL-7R, IL-7 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) serves as an extrinsic signal to specifically rearrange the TCR gamma locus.;B cell development is dependent on both direct interactions with stromal cells and their secreted cytokines. The precise mechanisms by which these interactions regulate B cell differentiation are currently unknown. We report here that a novel growth factor thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin (TSLP) can replace the activity of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in supporting B cell development in vitro. TSLP was found to promote the proliferation and differentiation of committed B220+ B cell progenitors from day 15 fetal liver. Phenotypic analysis of these cells revealed that they are at the pro-B cell stage of differentiation and express cell surface markers characteristic of pro-B cells cultured in IL-7. TSLP can replace the activity of IL-7 in supporting the progression of B lymphocytes from uncommitted bipotential precursors. In the absence of either TSLP or IL-7, the progeny of cells that give rise to mature B lymphocytes fail to develop from these bipotential precursors. Moreover, TSLP can substitute for IL-7 in supporting the sustained proliferative response exhibited by B cell progenitors from CBA/N mice. Together these results show that TSLP can replace the requirement for IL-7 during in vitro B cell development.;To examine the role of gamma c in lymphoid development, we have analyzed mice in which the gamma c gene was specifically inactivated by homologous recombination. These mice also serve as an animal model of human X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). Interestingly, gamma c knockout mice exhibited a somewhat different phenotype than humans with XSCID. Absolute T-cell numbers are greatly diminished in young gamma c-/Y mice, but accumulate with age. gamma delta T cells and NK cells are absent in gamma c-/Y mice and conventional B cells are greatly diminished, yet substantial numbers of peritoneal B-1 cells are present. Since humans with XSCID have essentially no mature T cells, it is especially striking that T cells are readily apparent in gamma c-/Y mice. This observation indicates that in these mice, the gamma c-dependent block in T cell development is less severe than it is in humans. It is possible but unproven that thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin, TSLP, contributes to thymocyte development in these mice. Since B-cell numbers are normal in humans with XSCID, it is also striking that gamma c-/Y mice paradoxically exhibit greatly diminished numbers of B cells. This likely indicates that IL-7 signaling plays a critical role in pre-B cell maturation in mice but is less important in humans. Thus, the abnormalities observed in gamma c-/Y mice have provided clues to assist in dissecting the role of cytokines and their receptors in lymphoid development and have also identified interesting differences in the regulation of this process in mice and humans.;One-way MLR was examined by using thymocytes (responder) from Fischer 344/NSIc rats in which urinary bladder cancers were induced by administration of N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine [(BBN) CAS: 3817-11-6], and lymph node lymphocytes (stimulator) from WKH/Hkm rats. From the 10th week of the administration, when only hyperplastic change was noticed in the bladder mucosa, progressive decrease of the MLR was detected in the thymus small lymphocyte population (TSLP) and the decrease was the most conspicuous in more dense, namely, intermediate and heavier, small lymphocyte subpopulations. When TSLP was pretreated with TF5 in vitro, the most restorative effects on the decreased MLR were found in hyperplastic stage and the effects were becoming less with the advance of tumor developments. Moreover, in scrutinizing the effects of TF5 on the small lymphocyte subpopulation in hyperplastic stage, the maximal restoration of the responsiveness was found in the heavier subpopulation.",,,,,,
